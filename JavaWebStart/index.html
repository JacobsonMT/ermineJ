    <h2>Webstart</h2>

    <p>For this to work, you must satisfy the following conditions:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>You must install a recent version of java (1.4.2 or later), which you
      can get <a href=
      "http://java.sun.com/j2se/corejava/index.jsp">here</a>.
      Download it and install it.</li>

      <li>You will have to get some annotation files, as we do not
      deliver these with the webstart package. You can get them <a
      href="/annots">here</a>. Get the annotation file(s) for the
      microarray platform(s) you are using. Unzip the files and put
      them somewhere you can find them. Do the same for the GO XML
      file, which is found <a href=
      "http://www.godatabase.org/dev/database/archive/latest/">here</a>
      (get the file named go_[date]-termdb.xml.gz). In the first step
      of running ermineJ, you will be asked to locate these files for
      the software.</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <div>
          There can be some problems with Webstart message windows
          coming up at the same time at ermineJ is trying to display
          dialog boxes. If you find yourself confronted with a dialog
          box nagging you about destop integration, but you can't click
          on it, try clicking on the ermineJ dialog box underneath and
          then going back to the Webstart.

        <div>
          If you have problems running ermineJ with webstart, when it
          worked before, you might try flushing your webstart cache.
          You do this by opening webstart directly (you may have an
          icon on your desktop) and going to
          File..preferences..advanced...clear folder.
        </div>
      </li>

      <li>
        <div>
          Currently help does not work for the webstart version. We are
          working on the problem. In the meantime you can use the <a
          href="../ermineJ-help/html">web-based help</a> .
