<h2>Webstart</h2>

  <p>For this to work, you must satisfy the following conditions:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>You must install a recent version of java (1.4.2), which you can get <a href="http://javashoplm.sun.com/ECom/docs/Welcome.jsp?StoreId=22&PartDetailId=j2re-1.4.2_05-oth-JPR&SiteId=JSC&TransactionId=noreg">here</a>.
Download it and install it.</li>
        <li>You will have to get some annotation files, as we do not
deliver these with the webstart package. You can get them <a
href="/annots">here</a>. Get the annotation file(s) for the microarray
platform(s) you are using. Unzip the files and put them somewhere you
can find them. Do the same for the GO XML file, which is found <a
href="http://www.godatabase.org/dev/database/archive/latest/">here</a>
(get the file named go_[date]-termdb.xml.gz). In the first step of running ermineJ, you will be asked to 
locate these files for the software.
</li>

      </ul>

<p>Note that there can be some problems with Webstart message windows coming up at the same time at
ermineJ is trying to display dialog boxes. If you find yourself confronted with a dialog box nagging you about
destop integration, but you can't click on it,
try clicking on the ermineJ dialog box underneath and then going back to the Webstart.</p>
