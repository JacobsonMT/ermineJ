    <h1>Input file formats:&nbsp;gene scores</h1>

    <p>A "gene score"&nbsp;is any value that is applied to genes in a
    microarray experiment and which represents some measure of
    "quality"&nbsp;or "interest". Examples might be a t-test p value or
    fold change. These scores must be computed separately and then
    supplied to the ermineJ software for analysis.</p>

    <h2><font color="#cc0033">!</font> Make sure your gene scores are
    on the right scale</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <div>
          <strong>If your gene scores are <em>not</em>
          p-values</strong> , then your score will be interpreted as
          "bigger is better". If this isn't the case, you should
          transform the values so this is true. No modification should
          be necessary for "fold-change" measures, though you might
          want to use the absolute value of log(fold change).
        </div>
      </li>

      <li>
        <div>
          <strong>If your gene score are p-values</strong> , then you
          should be sure to either -log your values, or use the
          -log options in the ermineJ software.
        </div>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2><font color="#cc0033">!</font> You need a complete set of gene
    scores, not just the "selected gene list"</h2>

    <p>Unlike some software packages, ermineJ requires a complete set
    of gene scores, rather than just those for the "selected genes".
    Thus, if your microarray has 12,000 probe sets on it, you will
    provide 12,000 gene scores. A&nbsp;caveat to this is that if you
    have filtered your data to exclude "unexpressed"&nbsp;genes (for
    example), you might only have gene scores for some probes. This is
    perfectly fine and the analysis will be based only on the probes
    for which you provide data.</p>

    <p>The resampling-based analysis requires the gene scores, while
    for other analyses it is not required.</p>

    <h2>Format</h2>

    <p>The gene score file is a simple tab-delimited text file,
    minimally having just two columns (like <a href=
    "../samples/geneScoresSample.txt">this example</a>). The first
    column contains the probe identifiers, while the second column
    contains the scores. A one-line header is expected (if you don't
    include the header, the first line of data will be skipped). Files
    with more than two columns are also fine.</p>
