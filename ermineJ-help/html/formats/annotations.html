 <h2>File information: gene annotations</h2>
 
 <p>Annotation files are provided for some popular (and some not-so-popular) array formats. These files contain the probe (or probe set)&nbsp;identifiers, the gene symbols and names, and gene set membership information. For our current annotations, this means that a list of the Gene Ontology terms associated with a gene are listed. For each term, the 'parent' terms are also listed, so that genes associated with very specific terms are also included in the less specific categories.</p>
 <p>You can <a
href="http://microarray.genomecenter.columbia.edu/annots/">download annotation files here</a>  (http://microarray.cpmc.columbia.edu/annots/)</p>
 <p>For species or platforms we don't support, ask us for assistance or set it up yourself. The files are not hard to prepare if you have Gene Ontology (or other gene set descriptor) annotations available. </p>
 <p>For species we support, but for new platforms, often you will be able to create a new annotation file by pulling information out of our existing files using a simple Perl script.</p>
