<h1>File information: gene annotations</h1>

<p>You can use two types of annotation files, ones we provide on our web
site, or ones provided by Affymetrix for their microarray platforms.
Requests for support of other formats will gladly be entertained. You
can also use files you have created, so long as they follow one of the
accepted formats.</p>

<p>You inform ermineJ of which format you are using with the pull-down
menu used at startup.</p>

<h2>Using files we provide</h2>

<p>In ermineJ, we refer to these as "ermineJ format", but the files are
very simple and useful in other contexts</p>

<p>You can <a href="http://microarray.genomecenter.columbia.edu/annots/">download
annotation files here</a> (http://microarray.cpmc.columbia.edu/annots/)</p>

<p>We provide annotation files for some popular (and some
not-so-popular) array formats. These files contain the probe (or probe
set)&nbsp;identifiers, the gene symbols and names, and gene set
membership information. For our current annotations, this means that a
list of the Gene Ontology terms associated with a gene are listed. For
each term, the 'parent' terms are also listed, so that genes associated
with very specific terms are also included in the less specific
categories.</p>

<p>For species or platforms we don't support, ask us for assistance or
set it up yourself. The files are not hard to prepare if you have Gene
Ontology (or other gene set descriptor) annotations available.</p>

<p>For species we support, but for new platforms, often you will be able
to create a new annotation file by pulling information out of our
existing files using a simple Perl script.</p>

<h2>Using Affymetrix files</h2>

<p>Obviously this only helps you if you are using an <a
	href="http://www.affymetrix.com">Affymetrix GeneChip</a>. (The writers
of ermineJ are not affiliated with Affymetrix in any way).</p>

<p>The files we tested our software on were obtained from the Affymetrix
site and are in CSV (comma-separated value) format. As of May 2005
ermineJ worked with these files, but if Affymetrix changes the format
(they have in the past)&nbsp;it is possible that they will no longer
work with ermineJ.</p>
<H2>Using files you create</H2>
<P>Annotation files that you created can be used so long as they adhere
to one of the accepted formats. There are a few things to consider:</P>
<UL>
	<LI>The probe IDs must exactly match the ones you provide in your Gene
	score file. Any probes not having an entry will be ignored.</LI>
	<LI>The gene symbols are used internally by the software to decide
	which genes are present on the array more than once. Therefore, if two
	probes refer to the same gene, make sure the symbol you use is the same
	for both probes. (It doesn't matter what the symbol is).</LI>
	<LI>The gene names or descriptions are optional, and blank values will
	just show up as "No description" or something similar.</LI>
	<LI>In the ermineJ format, the GO ids must be in "long" format (with
	the GO: prefix). The GO terms themselves should be omitted. The parents
	of all terms listed are automatically included in the analysis (subject
	to other constraints such as the maximum Gene Set size you set in the
	analysis), so there is no need to list these explicitly.</LI>
