    <h1>Gene set files</h1>

    <p>User-defined gene sets are saved in, and loaded from, a simple
    text file format (this format may change in future versions of the software). Knowledge of the format gives you the ability
    to define gene sets outside of ermineJ and import them.</p>
    
    <p>Here is a sample:</p>

<pre>

<p>(or <a href="../samples/geneset.txt">download the sample</a> as a file)</p>

<p>Gene set files created by ermineJ are saved in the directory <code>ermineJ.data/genesets</code>. This directory is installed in the
directory where ermineJ is installed (e.g., <code>Program Files/ermineJ/ermineJ.data/genesets</code>). You should place your own "handmade" gene set files
in this location so they are automatically visible to the software.</p>

<p>The full description of the format is:</p>

<ul>
<li>Each file describes just one gene set.</li>
<li>The file is plain text (ASCII)</li>
<li>The first line describes the type of identifier in the file and is either "probe" or "gene".</li>
<li>The second line is the name of the gene set.</li>
<li>The second line is a description of the gene set. There is no limit to the length of this description but in practice it should be just a few words.</li>
<li>The third and subsequent lines are the identifiers (probe ids or official gene names).</li>
</ul>
