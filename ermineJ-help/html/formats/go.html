    <h1>Input files:&nbsp;Gene Ontology</h1>

    <p>ErmineJ&nbsp;currently uses the GO XML file to obtain a complete
    set of data about GO&nbsp;terms and their definitions. We
    distribute a recent version of this file with the software. If you
    want to upgrade to a newer version, go to <a href=
    "http://www.godatabase.org/dev/database/archive/latest/">http://www.godatabase.org/dev/database/archive/latest/</a>
    and select the latest "termdb.rdf-xml" file (not the very large assocdb
    file). This file should be unzipped in your
    ermineJ.data/genesetdata directory.</p>

    <p>Note that our annotation files are not automatically assured to
    be 'in synch' with the file you download. Therefore you are advised
    use the GO&nbsp;XML&nbsp;file that was used during the latest
    annotation build. A link to that file is maintained at <a href=
    "http://microarray.cpmc.columbia.edu/annots/">http://microarray.cpmc.columbia.edu/annots/</a>
