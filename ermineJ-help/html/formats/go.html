<h2>Input files:&nbsp;Gene Ontology</h2>
<p>ErmineJ&nbsp;currently uses the GO XML file to obtain a complete set of data about GO&nbsp;terms and their definitions. We distribute a recent version of this file with the software. If you want to upgrade to a newer version, go to http://www.godatabase.org/dev/database/archive/latest/ and select the latest &quot;termdb&quot; file (not the very large assocdb file). This file should be unzipped in your ermineJ.data/genesetdata directory.</p>
<p>Note that our annotation files are not automatically assured to be 'in synch' with the file you download. Therefore you are advised use the GO&nbsp;XML&nbsp;file that was used during the latest annotation build. A link to that file is maintained at http://microarray.cpmc.columbia.edu/annots/.</p>
