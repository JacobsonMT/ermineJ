<h2>Changing the links in the gene set details view</h2>

<p>This task applies to the Gene set details view. In the details table,
the gene symbols appear as hyperlinks. By default these are links to
NCBI's Gene database, but you can change them to point to another web
site.</p>

<p>Access this option by&nbsp;selecting the menu "Options" and choosing
the "Change gene name url..." option.</p>

<p><IMG alt="" src="../images/gene-url-dialog.gif" border="0"></p>

<p>The "@@" symbols are where the gene symbol gets put in. For example,
if your gene is TRPA, then the link will end in TRPA; for the example
above, this will cause a search to be executed on the NCBI web site for
genes named "TRPA".</p>

<p>For other data sources, you have to know how the links (URLs) look to
know what to put in this box. But here are a few examples to show the
idea:</p>

<ul>
	<li>TAIR:&nbsp;<!--StartFragment -->
	http://www.arabidopsis.org/servlets/TairObject?type=gene&amp;name=@@
	<li>Google: http://www.google.com/search?as_q=Gene+@@&nbsp;&nbsp; (The
	added search term Gene is just a suggestion)
	<li>MGI:
	http://www.informatics.jax.org/javawi2//servlet/WIFetch?page=searchTool&amp;query=@@&amp;selectedQuery=Genes+and+Markers

	<
	li>Pubmed:http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=pubmed&amp;cmd=search&amp;term=@@</li>
