    <h2>Why are the number of gene and probes shown in the output panel
    incorrect when my data have been filtered?</h2>

    <p>The values are not incorrect, but could be confusing. This is
    due to a decision we made in the design of the user interface.</p>

    <p>The "# of probes" and "# of genes" columns show how many probe
    and genes are on the <em>array design</em> , not necessarily the
    number represented in your data.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>That is, if you have pre-filtered your input gene scores or your
    data (for correlation analysis), not all the genes on the array
    design are in your data set. For example, if you use the Affymetrix
    HG-U95A array, which has about 12,500 probe (sets), but filtered
    out ones you deemed "not expressed", you might only have 7000. This
    is going to affect the sizes of the gene categories
    represented.</p>

    <p>To display this, we would have to adjust the values in those
    columns to reflect the actual situation in your data. This would be
    fine if we only had one analysis to show. However, because we allow
    you to display multiple analyses, potentially from multiple data
    sets which have been filtered differently, there might not be a
    single "correct" value to show. Therefore we always just show the
    value for the full array design.</p>

    <p>You can always get the "correct" number by holding your mouse
    over the p value value; a tool-tip will appear which shows the
    actual values used for that gene set, for that particular run. When
    you save a run to a file, the values for the number of probes and
    genes &nbsp;are the ones used for your particular data. (Other
    types of work-arounds could be envisioned, which we are considering
    for a future version of the software)</p>
