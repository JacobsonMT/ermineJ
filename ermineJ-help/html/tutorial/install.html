    <h2>Installation notes</h2>

    <p>If you got this far, you've installed ermineJ at least partly
    successfully.</p>

    <p>The only additional information&nbsp; you should need is how the
    data directory is organized.</p>

    <p>By default, ermineJ expects a data directory
    (folder)&nbsp;called ermineJ.data to be present in the installation
    directory (e.g., C:\program files\ermineJ\ermineJ.data). This
    directory is used to store information needed by ermineJ during
    analysis. This directory should be created during installation.</p>

    <p>Custom gene sets go in the ermineJ/ermineJ.data/genesets folder.
    These are most easily created from within the ermineJ software, but
    you can add ones created externally by dropping them in
    ermineJ/ermineJ.data/genesets.</p>
