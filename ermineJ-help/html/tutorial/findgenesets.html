    <h1>Searching for Gene sets</h1>

	<p>In the main window, the menu item "GeneSets-->Find gene sets" opens a new dialog box
	that helps you find gene sets of interest.</p>
	
	<p>To use it, type text you want to search for and press "Enter" on  your keyboard or click on the "Find" button. The
	main window is updated to show only gene sets that match.</p>
	
	<p>The 'Reset' button clears your search and shows all gene sets again. Closing the Find window also resets the display. You can
	leave the Find window open as you perform other tasks.</p>
