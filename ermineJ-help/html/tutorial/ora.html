<h2>Tutorial: Over-representation (ORA)</h2>

<p>Over-representation analysis (ORA) examines the genes that meet a selection criterion and 
determines if there are gene sets which are statistically over-represented. This method
differs from the resampling-based analysis in that you must set a gene score threshold for
gene selection. The software does not support entering a list of selected genes. Instead,
you input the list of all genes along with their scores, and set the threshold.</p>
