    <h1>Using the software</h1>

    <p>When you first start up the software, you will be presented with
    the following dialog box.</p>

    <p><img style="WIDTH: 332px; HEIGHT: 183px" height="377" alt=""
    src="../images/init_screen.gif" width="558" border="0"></p>

    <p>Then you will have a brief wait while the data files are loaded.
    These data are used for the remaining analysis and will only have
    to be loaded once.</p>

    <p><img style="WIDTH: 578px; HEIGHT: 281px" height="450" alt=""
    src="../images/loading_screen.gif" width="886" border="0"></p>

    <p>Once loading is finished (~15-30 seconds) the following window
    is shown. The two key parts of this window are the "output panel'
    listing all the available gene sets, and the menu bar, which is
    used to perform analyses and other functions.</p>

    <p><img style="WIDTH: 586px; HEIGHT: 292px" height="450" alt=""
    src="../images/output_panel_start_screen.gif" width="886" border=
    "0"></p>

    <p>The Output panel always shows the four columns; clicking on a
    column header will re-sort the table according to the selected
    column.</p>

    <p>The columns are:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <div>
          Name - the name of the gene set.
        </div>
      </li>

      <li>
        <div>
          Description - the description of the gene set
        </div>
      </li>

      <li>
        <div>
          # of Probes - how many probes on the array are in the gene
          set. A "probe" is a "probe set" on Affymetrix arrays.
        </div>
      </li>

      <li>
        <div>
          # of Genes - how many genes are in the gene set. This value
          is always less than or equal to the number of probes, because
          some genes are represented by more than one probe on the
          array.
        </div>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>After an analysis has been done, additional columns will be
    added to this table. These are explained elsewhere.</p>

    <p>The menus are:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <div>
          File - currently only used to quit the program.
        </div>
      </li>

      <li>
        <div>
          Gene sets - used to modify or create new gene sets. See the
          <a href="classes.html">help for this item</a>.
        </div>
      </li>

      <li>
        <div>
          Analysis - used to run analyses, load or save.
        </div>
      </li>

      <li>
        <div>
          Help - used to reach this page.
        </div>
      </li>
    </ul><br>
