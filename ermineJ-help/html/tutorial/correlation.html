    <h1>Tutorial: Correlation resampling</h1>

    <h2>Method Overview</h2>

    <p>Please note that the correlation resampling method still does
    not completely implement corrections for multiply-represented
    genes. In the meantime this method should be considered
    experimental. (basically I'm too busy to fix it)</p>

    <p>Unlike ORA and Gene Score Resampling, this method examines the
    gene expression profiles themselves, not the gene scores for each
    gene. A score is computed for a gene set based on how correlated
    the expression profiles are.</p>

    <p>This can be thought of as a measure of how well the genes in the
    set cluster together, but they need not all be in the same cluster.
    Thus a gene set that contains two coherent clusters that encompass
    most of the genes in the set will tend to get a good score (though
    not as good as a gene set that is just one big cluster).</p>

    <p>Correlatoin resampling is the most computationally intensive
    method implemented by ermineJ. For this reason we recommend setting
    the number of iterations lower. Future versions of ermineJ will use
    some optimizations to make this method more usable.</p>

    <h2>Walkthrough</h2>

    <p>If you have read the ORA and Gene Score resampling pages, you
    will recognize the first 4 steps of the wizard. The only different
    one is the last one:</p>
