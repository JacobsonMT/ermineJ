<h1>Running an analysis and using the output panel</h1>

<p>To run an analysis, choose "run analysis" from the analysis menu.</p>

<p>The first screen you are presented with is this one:</p>

<p><IMG height="284" alt="" src="../images/analysis1.JPG" width="418"
	border="0"></p>

<p>Choose the type of analysis you want to do. Directions on the
specific types of analysis are available:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<div><A href="ora.html">ORA</A>&nbsp; - start here to read general
	information about conducting an analysis.</div>
	<li>
	<div><A href="resampling.html">Gene score resampling</A></div>
	<li>
	<div><A href="correlation.html">Correlation</A></div>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>(the rest of this tutorial assumes you have run some analysis using
the directions)</p>

<p>When you are done with an analysis, the output panel will show the
results. Here is the output panel after an analysis. Note that the "# of
probes" and "# of genes" columns show how many probe and genes are on
the array design, not necessarily the number represented in your data.
Please read this <A href="numitems.html">note</A> for more explanation.</p>

<p><IMG alt="" src="../images/after-analysis2.JPG" border="0"></p>

<p>Note how the results of each run are show in columns after the
standard four. Each value is the p value associated with the gene set
for that run.</p>

<p>If you hold the mouse over a p-value for a gene set, a tool tip will
be displayed that shows additional information, including the correct
number of probes and genes for the gene set as represented in the data
you used.</p>

<p>The colors indicate classes that passed a multiple test correction.
Read details <A href="mtc.html">here</A>.</p>

<h2>Deleting a run</h2>

<p>You can <strong>delete a run by right-clicking on its column
heading&nbsp;</strong> and selecting "delete this run".</p>

<h2>Viewing the details of a gene set</h2>

<p>You can <strong>double-click on a row</strong> to get the details for
a gene set. For example, to view the details for run 2, "response to
hypoxia", click on the cell in the "Run 2 Pval" column on the "response
to hypoxia" row. The window you get is explained <A
	href="visualize.html">here</A>.</p>

<h2>View information about a gene set on the GO web site</h2>

<p>By <strong>right-clicking on a row</strong>, you will get&nbsp;a
pop-up menu. The first item on this menu should open a web browser
showing the <a
	href="http://www.godatabase.org/cgi-bin/amigo/go.cgi?search_constraint=terms&amp;action=replace_tree">Amigo</a>
web page for the gene set selected.</p>

<p><IMG alt="" src="../images/outputpanel_leftclick.JPG" border="0"></p>

<p>The other menu item allows you to <A href="classes.html">view or
modify the gene set</A>.</p>
