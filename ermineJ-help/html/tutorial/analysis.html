    <h1>Running an analysis and using the output panel</h1>

    <p>To run an analysis, choose "run analysis" from the analysis
    menu.</p>

    <p>The first screen you are presented with is this one:</p>

    <p><img alt="" src="../images/analysis1.JPG" border="0"></p>

    <p>Choose the type of analysis you want to do. Directions on the
    specific types of analysis are available:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <div>
          <a href="ora.html">ORA</a>&nbsp; - start here to read general
          information about conducting an analysis.
        </div>
      </li>

      <li>
        <div>
          <a href="resampling.html">Gene score resampling</a>
        </div>
      </li>

      <li>
        <div>
          <a href="correlation.html">Correlation</a>
        </div>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>(the rest of this tutorial assumes you have run some analysis
    using the directions)</p>

    <p>When you are done with an analysis, the output panel will show
    the results. Here is the output panel after an analysis.</p>

    <p><img alt="" src="../images/after-analysis2.JPG" border="0"></p>

    <p>Note how the results of each run are show in columns after the
    standard four. Each value is the p value associated with the gene
    set for that run.</p>

    <p>The colors indicate classes that passed a multiple test
    correction. Read details <a href="mtc.html">here</a>.</p>

    <h2>Deleting a run</h2>

    <p>You can <strong>delete a run by right-clicking on its column
    heading&nbsp;</strong> and selecting "delete this run".</p>

    <h2>Viewing the details of a gene set</h2>

    <p>You can <strong>double-click on a row</strong> to get the
    details for a gene set. For example, to view the details for run 2,
    "response to hypoxia", click on the cell in the "Run 2 Pval" column
    on the "response to hypoxia" row. The window you get is explained
    <a href="visualize.html">here</a>.</p>

    <h2>View information about a gene set on the GO we site</h2>

    <p>By <strong>right-clicking on a row</strong>, you will get&nbsp;a
    pop-up menu. The first item on this menu should open a web browser
    showing the <a href=
    "http://www.godatabase.org/cgi-bin/amigo/go.cgi?search_constraint=terms&amp;action=replace_tree">Amigo</a>
    web page for the gene set selected.</p>

    <p><img alt="" src="../images/outputpanel_leftclick.JPG" border=
    "0"></p>

    <p>The other menu item allows you to <a href="classes.html">modify
    the gene set</a>.</p>
