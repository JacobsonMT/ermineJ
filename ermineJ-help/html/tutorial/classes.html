  <h2>Tutorial: gene sets</h2>
  <p>A <b>gene set</b>&nbsp;is any grouping of genes defined by criteria other than the data currently being analyzed. Our baseline gene sets are defined using Gene Ontology terms as applied in the publicly available sources listed on the GO web site.</p>
  <p>You can import, define, or modify gene sets as you like. This page explains how.</p>
  <h2>Modifying an existing gene set</h2>
  <p>The easiest thing to do is modify a pre-existing gene set by adding or removing genes. This is done using the &quot;Modify gene set&quot; wizard. This can be accessed either by right-clicking on the gene set in the Output Panel or by selecting the &quot;modify&quot; item from the Gene set menu.</p>
