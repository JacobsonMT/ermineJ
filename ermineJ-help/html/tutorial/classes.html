    <h1>Viewing, defining and modifying gene sets</h1>

    <p>A <b>gene set</b>&nbsp;is any grouping of genes defined by
    criteria other than the data currently being analyzed. Our baseline
    gene sets are defined using Gene Ontology terms as applied in the
    publicly available sources listed on the GO web site.</p>

    <p>You can view, import, define, or modify gene sets as you like,
    using the "gene set" menu on the main panel of the software. This
    page explains how.</p>

    <h2><a name="viewgeneset"></a>Viewing a gene set</h2>

    <p>When the software first starts, the gene sets are defined by the
    microarray annotation file you uploaded. Prior to doing any
    analysis, or at any other time, you can view the list of genes in a
    gene set in one of two ways.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <div>
          You can "right click" on the gene set name and select
          "View/Modify gene set". You will be shown the details for
          that gene set in a new window. If you are just looking, and
          don't want to modify the gene set, just hit cancel when you
          are done.
        </div>
      </li>

      <li>
        <div>
          You can select the "View/Modify gene set" from the analysis
          menu. In this case you then select which gene set to view.
        </div>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>If you have already done an analysis, you can view the gene set
    in the context of your results by double-clicking on the p value
    for the gene set, as described <a href="visualize.html">here</a>.</p>

    <h2>Creating a new gene set</h2>

    <p>Select "create new gene set" from the "gene set"&nbsp;menu. This
    gets you to the new gene set wizard.</p>

    <p>You can import a file describing a gene set, or you can create
    one manually from the list of genes on the array you are using. You
    choose which to use by selecting "file" or "manual"&nbsp;in the
    first step of the new gene set wizard:</p>

    "558" border="0"></p>

    <h2>Adding new genes manually</h2>

    <p>Select probes from the left panel and click "add"&nbsp;to move
    them to the right panel. Note that here we added one probe for the
    ABCA1 gene, but four probes were moved to the right. This is
    because there are four probes which assay ABCA1; all of them are
    added to the gene set automatically. Similarly you can delete
    probes from the right panel by using the 'delete' button.</p>

    <p><img height="377" alt="" src="../images/new_class_manual2.gif"
    width="558" border="0"></p>

    <h3>Using the 'find' function to help locate genes.</h3>

    <p>To make it easier to build new gene sets, a 'find' function is
    provided. Here we searched for "cell cycle" and found 6 probes.</p>

    <p><img height="377" alt="" src=
    "../images/new_class_manual_find2.gif" width="558" border="0"></p>

    <h3>Giving the new gene set a name and description</h3>

    <p>After adding the probes and genes to the gene set and hitting
    "next", you will be asked to enter a new identifier and description
    for the gene set you defined. When you hit finish, the information
    about this gene set is saved to disk and you are returned to the
    main panel.</p>

    <p><img height="377" alt="" src="../images/new_class_manual3.gif"
    width="558" border="0"></p>

    <p>After hitting 'finish', the new gene set is shown in color in
    the output panel. The gene set is also saved to disk for future
    use. The format and file locations are described <a href="../formats/geneset.html">here</a>.</p>

    "../images/output_panel_after_new.gif" width="886" border="0"></p>

    <h2>Entering a gene set from a file</h2>

  <p>Gene sets can be loaded in from files created by the user. These files should be stored in your ermineJ installation directory
  under ermineJ.data/genesets. For details on the format, see <a href="../formats/geneset.html">this page</a>.</p>
  
  <p>To load a gene set from a file,

    "../images/new_class_file_sample.gif" width="412" border="0"></p>

    <h2>Modifying an existing gene set</h2>

    <p>You can modify a pre-existing gene set by adding or removing
    genes. This is done using the "Modify gene set" wizard. This can be
    accessed either by right-clicking on the gene set in the Output
    Panel or by selecting the "modify" item from the Gene set menu.</p>

    <p>If you use the "Gene set" menu, you will get a list of all the
    available gene sets. Select one by clicking on it. You can use the
    find function to help locate a specific set. After this step, the
    procedure is very similar to the "create new" gene set procedure
    explained above.</p>

    <p><img height="377" alt="" src="../images/modify_class1.gif"
    width="558" border="0"></p>

    <p>The next screen lists the available probes on the left, and the
    probes in the set on the right. Similar to the 'create new gene
    set' procedure shown above, you can add or remove probes.</p>

    <p><img height="377" alt="" src="../images/modify_class2.gif"
    width="558" border="0"></p>

    <p>Finally, you can provide your gene set with a new name. This is
    actually optional:&nbsp;if you don't provide a new name, the old
    gene set will simply be replaced.</p>

    <p><img height="377" alt="" src="../images/modify_class3.gif"
    width="558" border="0"></p>

    <p>As for new gene sets, the modified gene sets are shown on the
    main panel in a different color to indicate they were modified by
    the user.</p>
