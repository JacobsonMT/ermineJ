    <h1>Frequently asked questions</h1>

    <p><strong>How do I know if a gene set p value is
    'significant'</strong></p>

    <p>One has to consider the problem of multiple testing, but because
    the gene sets (Gene Onotology group) overlap, simple methods will
    be too conservative. For this reason we don't recommend using a
    Bonferroni correction, though if a Bonferonni correction yields
    'significant' results, you can certainly consider them reasonably
    trustworth.</p>

    <p>The software implements a false discovery rate (FDR) algorithm
    that leads to p values shown in a color at different levels of
    false discovery rate (see this <a href=
    "tutorial/mtc.html">page</a>). However, this method still assumes
    the gene sets are independent and will lead to a convervative
    estimate of the FDR.</p>

    <p>If you want to use Bonferroni, you can either use the
    command-line interface, or compute them yourself.&nbsp;To compute
    the Bonferroni-corrected p values, multiply your gene set p values
    by the number of gene sets analyzed (maximum of 1). Then you can
    use a threshold of 0.05 (which would not otherwise be
    reasonable).</p>

    <p><strong>Do I input the list of gene scores for the significantly
    changed genes, or all the genes?</strong></p>

    <p>All of them. The resampling method uses the gene scores for all
    the genes. The built-in overrepresentation analysis will use the
    threshold you set in the gene score threshold parameter to select
    genes. Note that we find that removing unexpressed genes can help
    the analysis, but it isn't required. Note that if your data have
    been filtered, the output panel does not list the actual number of
    probes or genes in your gene sets. See <a href=
    "tutorial/numitems.html">this page</a> &nbsp;for a
    clarification.</p>

    <p><strong>How do I find out which genes are in a gene set without
    doing an analysis?</strong></p>

    <p>You can use the "View/Modify Gene set" tools, available from the
    main 'analysis' menu, or the context-specific pop-up menu on the
    gene set list. See <a href="tutorial/classes.html#viewgeneset">this page</a></p>

    <p><strong>When I open the output file in Notepad it looks like a
    mess of letters and numbers.</strong></p>

    <p>The output will not look right when viewed in a text editor or a
    web browser. It will look correct in Excel if you open it as a tab
    delimited file.</p>

    <p><strong>My excel spreadsheet with my gene scores isn't being
    accepted as input.</strong></p>

    <p>You cannot input Excel spreadsheets; you have to save them as
    text first. See <a href="excel-astext.html">this page</a> for
    details.</p>

    <p><strong>I don't see an annotation file for my microarray. What
    should I do?</strong></p>

    <p>Unfortunately we cannot generally create annotations for
    microarrays that are not commonly used. If we identify a commonly
    used platform, we will add it. This means that 'home made' spotted
    microarrays are not supported in most cases. Feel free to let us
    know if you have a microarray design that needs annotations for
    class scoring. In the meantime, you could try to use one of the
    "Generic" annotation files we provide, possibly with the help of
    your local friendly bioinformatician.</p>

    <p><strong>Why did I see a warning "Attempt to take the log of a
    non-positive value"?</strong></p>

    <p>If your gene score file contains negative or zero values, and
    you check the "negative log-transform gene scores" box, you will
    see this error. If this concerns you, you should clean up your gene
    score file. If not, ermineJ sets these values to a small number
    (10<sup>-15</sup> ).</p>

    <p><strong>Why did I see a warning "<font color="#2a00ff" size=
    "1"><font color="#000000" size="4">Some probes in your gene score
    file don't match the ones in the annotation file</font></font>
    "?</strong></p>

    <p>This happens if your gene annotation file isn't the right one
    for the microarray you used (in which case your analysis will not
    work well), but can also happen if your file format isn't quite
    right. The analysis still proceeds when this happens.</p>

    <p><strong>The resampling is taking too long, any
    suggestions?</strong></p>

    <p>This problem affects the correlation score analysis in
    particular, which is very computationally intensive.</p>

    <p>There are few ways to speed things up. One is to
    <strong>uncheck</strong> <font color="#000000">the "</font><font
    color="#2a00ff" size="1"><font color="#000000" size="4"><font size=
    "3"><em>Always use full resampling</em></font>" <font size=
    "3">checkbox in the analysis setup wizard. This enables
    approximations which, while potentially yielding less accurate
    p-values, greatly increase processing speed. The results you get
    with this box unchecked will be reasonably similar to what you
    would get with full resampling.</font></font></font></p>

    <p>Another tip is to not look at very large values for the "maximum
    class size" value. We usually use a value on the order of 200.</p>

    <p>Finally, you can reduce the number of iterations. You might try
    temporarily setting this to 10000 while you experiment with the
    other settings, and then, once you find a setting you like, you can
    crank up the iterations for the "final" run (for example to 200000,
    which still should not take very long for the gene-score based
    resampling).</p>

    <p><strong>What happens to probes that don't have any GO
    annotations?</strong></p>

    <p>They are ignored.</p>

    <p><strong>For resampling analysis of gene scores, how is the gene
    score threshold determined?</strong></p>

    <p>This is a trick question. There is no threshold used. Instead,
    all genes in a set contribute to the score for the gene set. For
    more details on how this works, see <a href=
    "tutorial/resampling.html">this page</a> .</p>

    <p><strong>What happens if there are two probes for&nbsp;one
    gene?</strong></p>

    <p>See <a href="tutorial/genereps.html">this page</a> .</p>

    <p><strong>Why are the number of gene and probes shown in the
    output panel incorrect when my data set has been
    filtered?</strong></p>
