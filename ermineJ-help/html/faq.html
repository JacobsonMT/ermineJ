    <h1>Frequently asked questions</h1>

    <p><strong>Do I input the list of gene scores for the significantly
    changed genes, or all the genes?</strong></p>

    <p>All of them. The resampling method uses the gene scores for all
    the genes. The built-in overrepresentation analysis will use the
    threshold you set in the gene score threshold parameter to select
    genes. Note that we find that removing unexpressed genes can help
    the analysis, but it isn't required.</p>

    <p><strong>When I open the output file in Notepad it looks like a
    mess of letters and numbers.</strong></p>

    <p>The output will not look right when viewed in a text editor or a
    web browser. It will look correct in Excel if you open it as a tab
    delimited file.</p>

    <p><strong>I don't see annotation file for my microarray. What
    should I do?</strong></p>

    <p>Unfortunately we cannot generally create annotations for
    microarrays that are not commonly used. If we identify a commonly
    used platform, we will add it. This means that 'home made' spotted
    microarrays are not supported in most cases. Feel free to let us
    know if you have a microarray design that needs annotations for
    class scoring.</p>

    <p><strong>Why did I see a warning "Attempt to take the log of a
    non-positive value"?</strong></p>

    <p>If your gene score file contains negative or zero values, and
    you check the "negative log-transform gene scores" box, you will
    see this error. If this concerns you, you should clean up your gene
    score file. If not, ermineJ sets these values to a small number
    (10<sup>-15</sup> ).</p>

    <p><strong>The resampling is taking too long, any
    suggestions?</strong></p>

    <p>There are few ways to speed things up. One is to not look at
    very large values for the "maximum class size" value. We usually
    use a value near 200. Another is to reduce the number of
    iterations. You might try temporarily setting this to 10000 while
    you experiment with the other settings, and then, once you find a
    setting you like, you can crank up the iterations for the "final"
    run (for example to 200000, which still should not take very
    long).</p>

    <p><strong>What happens to probes that don't have any GO
    annotations?</strong></p>

    <p>They are ignored.</p>

    <p><strong>For resampling analysis of gene scores, how is the gene
    score threshold determined?</strong></p>

    <p>This is a trick question. There is no threshold used. Instead,
    all genes in a set contribute to the score for the gene set. For
    more details on how this works, see <a href=
    "tutorial/resampling.html">this page</a> .</p>

    <p><strong>What happens if there are two probes for&nbsp;one
    gene?</strong></p>
