  <p>ErmineJ performs analyses of <b>gene sets</b> in <b>expression microarray data</b>. A typical goal is to determine whether particular biological pathways are &quot;doing something interesting&quot; in the data. The software is designed to be used by biologists with little or no informatics background. A command-line interface is available for users who wish to script the use of ermineJ.</p>
  <p>Key features include:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Implementation of several methods for gene set analysis, including one based on gene correlation.
   <li>Gene sets receive statistical scores (p-values), and multiple test correction is supported.
   <li>Support of the Gene Ontology terminology
   <li>User files are in a simple text format.
   <li>Users can modify gene sets or create new ones.
   <li>The results can be visualized within the software.
   <li>It is simple to compare multiple analyses of the same data set with different settings.
   <li>Hyperlinks are provided to external sites to allow more efficient browsing of the results.
