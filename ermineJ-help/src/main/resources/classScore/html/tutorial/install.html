<h1>Installation notes</h1>

<h2>WebStart</h2>

<p>The simplest way to use ermineJ might be to use the <a
	href="http://www.chibi.ubc.ca/ermineJ/webstart">webstart</a>.
This allows you to run ermineJ without running an installer.</p>

<h2>Windows</h2>

<p>Download the installer (ermineJ-XXXXX.exe), and double-click on it.
The installation wizard will take you through the steps to install the
software. After installation, ermineJ can be started by double-clicking
on the desktop icon.</p>

<p>The only additional general information you should need is how the
data directory is organized.</p>

<p>By default, ermineJ expects a data directory (folder)&nbsp;called
ermineJ.data to be present in the installation directory (e.g.,
C:\Program Files\ermineJ\ermineJ.data). This directory is used to store
information needed by ermineJ during analysis. This directory should be
created during installation.</p>

<p>Custom gene sets created by the software go in the
ermineJ/ermineJ.data/genesets folder. These are most easily created from
within the ermineJ software, but you can add ones created externally by
dropping them in ermineJ/ermineJ.data/genesets, or loading them from
within ermineJ.</p>

<h3>Other platforms</h3>

<p>For other platforms, we provide a "generic bundle" that can be used
to run ermineJ without an installer.</p>

<ol>
	<li>Unpack the distribution. You should end up with a directory called
	'ermineJ-2.1' or something like that.</li>
	<li>Set the enviroment variable ERMINEJ_HOME to this directory.</li>
	<li>Add $ERMINEJ_HOME/bin to your path, if you want to make it easier
	to execute.</li>
	<li>You can now execute ermineJ by running the script ermineJ.sh (Unix,
	should also work on Mac OSX) or ermineJ.bat (Windows) in the bin
	directory.</li>
</ol>

<p>By default, executing the script will simply print usage
instructions. To fire up the gui, use <code>ermineJ.sh -G</code>.</p>

<p>By using the other options, you can cause ermineJ to run an analysis
non-interactively. The command line interface is described <a
	href="cli.html">here</a></p>
