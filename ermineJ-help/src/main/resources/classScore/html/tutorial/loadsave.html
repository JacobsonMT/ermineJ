		<h1>
			Saving and loading analyses
		</h1>
		<p>
			You can save an analysis you did and load it again later.
		</p>
		<p>
			These capabilities are accessed in the main window using the
			"Analysis" menu.
		</p>
		<h2>
			Saving:
		</h2>

		</p>
		<p>
			You can also optionally check a box to "include all genes" in the
			output. If you select that, each line in the output file will include
			a list of genes which are in the gene set.
		</p>
		<p>
			The output format is described
			<a href="../formats/saved-data.html">here</a>
		</p>
		<h2>
			Loading an analysis
		</h2>
		<p>
			Once you have saved an analysis, you can load it back in using the
			"Analysis -> load analysis" item:
		</p>
		<p>
			<img alt="" src="../images/loadanalysis.gif" border="0">
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Note:</strong> In order to load in an analysis, you must have the same gene annotations loaded as when you did the analysis.
			This limitation is to avoid problems finding annotation files based on the paths stored in the result file headers. Thus if you want to 
			send your result file to someone else to examine in ermineJ, you should also include your annotation file (and any custom gene set files).
