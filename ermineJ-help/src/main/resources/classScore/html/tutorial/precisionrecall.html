	<h1>Tutorial: Precision-Recall scoring</h1>

	<h2>Method Overview</h2>

	<p>
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_and_recall">Precision-recall</a> curves are a standard way to analyze
		the quality of a classifier, as are <a href="roc.html">ROC</a> curves. The difference between ROC and Precision-recall
		(PR) is that PR is mostly concerned with what is happening at the top of the ranking, while ROC looks at the whole
		ranking. The precision-recall method in ErmineJ is similar in intent to the method popularized in "<a
			href="http://www.broadinstitute.org/gsea">GSEA</a>", but uses standard precision-recall (GSEA originally used
		Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistics, but was changed to use a modified K-S statistic that makes it more
		precision-recall-like).
	</p>

	<p>Like the ROC method, the PRC method uses only the ranks of the gene scores. That is, all it cares about is the
		ordering of items obtained by your gene scores (e.g., t-test or fold-change), but doesn't use the information about
		the relative values of the scores.</p>

	<h2>When to use PRC scoring</h2>

	<p>
		PR-scoring is rather like the <a href="ora.html">ORA method</a> in that it is concerned with what is going on at the
		"top" of your list, but unlike ORA it does not use a threhold. Thus PR-scoring would be appropriate whenever you
		consider the ORA method appropriate. The PR method requires a resampling step, so it is slower to run than ORA.
	<h2>Walkthrough</h2>

	<p>
		The precision-recall method workflow is the same as the <a href="resampling.html">Gene set resampling</a> method. The
		difference is in how the scores are computed. Whereas for GSR the score is the mean (or other summary statistic) of
		the gene scores in the set, PR uses the average precision, which is closely related to the area under the
		precision-recall curve.
