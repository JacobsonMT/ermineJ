			Handling repeated genes
		</h1>

		<p>
			Any given gene can occur more than once in a microarray data set.
			This is due to the occurrence of two or more probes (or probe sets)
			that target the same gene. On most microarray designs we have looked
			at, somewhere in the neighborhood of 30 percent of the probes are
			"repeats", though this depends on the design. We refer to these as
			"gene replicates", because they provide replicate measures of the
			same gene. However, these "replicates" may not be equivalent: they
			may target different splice forms, or have different sensitivity or
			specificity. In some cases a probe set may not work at all and give
			very poor signals, while another probe for the same gene gives a
			robust signal.
		</p>

		<p>
			In a gene set score analysis, it does not make sense to count each of
			these "replicates" independently when determining the size of a gene
			set: a gene set that consists of five replicates of the same gene
			should not be considered five genes in the statistical analysis. Thus
			in ermineJ a gene is only counted once. For the correlation analysis,
			each pair of genes is only counted once. This means that even if
			there are five occurrences of a gene on the array, it will only be
			counted once.
		</p>

		<p>
			What remains to determine is how to summarize the results for the
			replicates: the five replicates in our example have to be distilled
			down to a single value.
		</p>

		<p>
			ErmineJ offers two ways of dealing with this situation, one which is
			conservative and one which, while less conservative, might be
			sensible when there is uncertainty as to the reliability of
			individual replicates.
		</p>

		<p>
			The conservative choice is referred to as "
			<strong>Mean</strong>": the different occurrences of the gene are
			each given equal weight. For correlation analysis, the same rule
			applies but at the level of pairs of genes. Thus if there are two
			replicates of gene A and two replicates of gene B, a total of 4
			comparisons is possible. The final contribution of the A-B comparison
			is 1/4 of the correlations measured between all the replicates.
			<strong>This method makes the most sense to use if your
				replicates are usually actual spot replicates, that is, the same
				sequence occuring multiple times on the array.</strong>
		</p>

		<p>
			The less conservative choice is referred to as "
			<strong>Best</strong>": the only score counted for a gene is the best
			one. Thus if a gene has two replicates with scores 3 and 4 (- log p
			values), then only the 4 is counted; with the mean method the final
			value would be 3.5. For correlation analysis, the best pairwise
			correlation is stored. In the A-B example give above, this means that
			the best of the four comparisons is kept.
			<strong>This method might make more sense if your
				"replicates" tend to target different transcripts or sets of
				transcripts</strong>
		</p>

		<h2>
			Which method should you use?
		</h2>

		<p>
			The choice of which method to use depends on how conservative you
			want to be, combined with knowledge you have about the microarray
			design. If you consider gene "replicates" not to really be
			replicates, then using the "best" option might make sense. If your
			microarray design just has exact replicate spots of the same
			sequence, then using "Mean" might be sensible.
