			Searching for Gene sets
		</h1>

		<p>
			ErmineJ has several facilities to make it easier to locate gene sets
			of interest
		</p>

		<p>
			In the main window, the search box appears in the bottom of the screen. Click or press Ctrl-f to activate it. Press Ctrl-f again to reverse
			the effect of the search if you have already performed one.
		</p>

		<h2>
			Search by gene set
		</h2>

		<p>
			To use it, type text you want to search for and press "Enter" on your
			keyboard example we searched for "synapse". To clear the filtering, type "Ctrl-f" or clear the text in the field and press enter again.
		</p>

		<h2>
			Search by gene
		</h2>

		<p>
			Alternatively, you can search by gene.  Check the "Search genes" box to activate this feature. 
			Here is an example of searching for
			"snap25". All gene sets containing this gene are displayed. Note that
			you must enter the official gene symbol (capitalization doesn't
			matter).
		</p>

		<p>To clear the filtering, type "Ctrl-f" or clear the text in the field and press enter again.</p>

		<p>
			In the treeview, the results of a search are indicated by greying out
			all gene sets that don't meet criteria.

				<h2>
					Where are the gene sets I defined?
				</h2>

				<p>
					The key "ctrl-U" (or the corresponding menu item) toggles the
					display between showing all gene sets and just the user-defined
					gene sets. This is useful because the user-defined gene sets can
					easily get lost among all the others. You can combine this with a search using the box at the bottom of the window.
				</p> <img border=0
					src="userDefinedGeneSetsInMainPanel_files/userDefinedGeneSetsInMainPanel0.png"
					usemap="#frame0map"> <br> <br>

				<p>
					Similarly, in the tree view, there is a separate subtree for
					user-defined ("Custom") gene sets, listed first.
				</p> <img border=0

				<h2>
					How do I find gene sets in the tree?
				</h2>

				<p>
					It can be hard to find a gene set in the tree because they can be
					anywhere in the hierarchy. Because searches generally can yield
					multiple gene sets, currently the search function doesn't work the
					way you might think in the tree view. Instead, locate the gene set
					you want in the table, and then use the context-specific menu
					(right-click or option-click) to choose the "Find this set in the
					tree panel" option.
				</p>

				<p>
					This switches you to the tree view and highlights the gene set you
					requested.
