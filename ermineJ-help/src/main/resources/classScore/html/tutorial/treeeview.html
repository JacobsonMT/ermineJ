	<h1>The ErmineJ Tree view</h1>
	<h2>Important to know about</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Double-click on a node to view the details. Single-click on a node to expand its immediae children.</li>
		<li>Right-click (MacOS:option-click) on a node to get more tools.</li>
		<li>If you have more than one result set loaded, you can choose the one to show in the tree using the "Results"
			menu.</li>
		<li>Terms which have no genes in your annotations are hidden by default but can be shown using the pop-up menu.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>What the icons mean</h2>

	<p>The icons indicate the state of a node, as well as that of its children. This makes it easier to see that even
		if a term is not "significant", it has a child term that does. To expose the subtree at a node, right-click and select
		"Expand this node".</p>

	<h2>Limitations</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Only one path to the root is shown per GO term. Other immediate parents of each term are only shown in the
			tool-tip for the term. To see an accurate representatio of the GO hierarchy, use the <a
			href="http://amigo.geneontology.org/">GO consortium's web site</a>, also accessible through the context (pop-up)
			menu.
		</li>
		<li>Attempting to expand large sections of the tree is slow; you may see an error message saying it was
			cancelled.</li>
	</ul>
