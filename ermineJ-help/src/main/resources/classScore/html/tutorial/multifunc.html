			Gene multifunctionality (or just "multifunctionality" for short)
			refers to the fact that some genes have more "functions" than others.
			Recently
			<a
				href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0017258">our
				lab showed (Gillis and Pavlidis, 2011)</a> how this has a profound
			effect on the analysis of functional genomics data. A manuscript
			describing the effects on enrichment-type analyses is in preparation.
		</p>
		<p>
			ErmineJ has several features designed to make it easier to detect and
			understand the effect of multifunctionality on your analysis. These
			are detailed in the help sections relevant to the features. This page
			provides some background information on how multifunctionality is
			computed and how to interpret it.
		</p>

		<h2>
			Defining function
		</h2>
		<p>
			For the purposes of ErmineJ, a "function" is defined by the
			annotations a gene has. For standard uses of ErmineJ, this means gene
			ontology terms. Whether those annotations are a "true" representation
			of the multifunctionality of a gene is of no consequence for the
			effects on the analysis. For more discussion of this issue see the
			article linked above.
		</p>

		<h2>
			Computing the multifunctionality of a gene
		</h2>
		<p>
			While the number of GO terms a gene has is a simple measure of
			multifunctionality, ErmineJ uses the definition given in Gillis and
			Pavlidis (2011). This definition takes into account the size of GO
			groups. Thus a gene that is a member of many small GO groups is more
			multifunctional than a gene that is a member of the same number of
			large GO groups. This definition arises from a mathematical proof of
			the "optimal" ranking of genes, but it makes sense that large,
			"general" functions be counted less. In practice this doesn't make
			that much of a difference and you will notice the computed
			multifunctionality is correlated with the number of GO terms. If it
			makes it easier to understand, just think of multifunctionality as
			the number of GO terms.
		</p>

		<h2>
			Computing the multifunctionality of a gene group
		</h2>
		<p>
			Some gene groups (e.g. GO terms) tend to contain genes which are also
			members of many other GO groups. Such "correlated" GO terms are
			particularly problematic. ErmineJ computes the multifunctionality of
			a gene group as described in Gillis and Pavlidis (2011). The score is
			the area under the reciever operating characteristic curve obtained
			by comparing the genes in the group to the ranking provided by the
			multifunctionality definition given above. Thus, a value of 0.5
			indicates that the genes in the group are not biased towards
			multifunctionality; 1.0 is the maximum bias; and 0.0 (not observed in
			practice) would mean the genes in the group are highly
			"unifunctional".
		</p>

		<h2>
			Interpreting mulitfunctionality
		</h2>

		<p>
			There are two ways that ErmineJ uses multifunctionality to highlight
			its importance. These ways are demonstrated precisely on the relevant
			help pages. Here we address some of the theoretical considerations.
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Multifunctionality bias in gene scores</strong> - When you
			provide ErmineJ with a ranked list of genes, presumably that list
			came from some experimental result. Given
			<em>any</em> experiment, a priori, we expect multifunctional genes to
			"show up". This should be intuititive: a gene that is involved in
			many functions will be found to be "relevant" in many types of
			experiments.
		</p>
		<p>
			The GO terms associated with a gene can be thought of as a rough
			proxy measure for the true multifunctionality of a gene (since the
			true multifunctionality is not readily observable). Using the measure
			of multifunctionality based on GO, ErmineJ will tell you if your
			input list is "enriched" for multifunctional genes. In our
			experience, it is not all that common for an input list to be
			strongly correlated with the multifunctionality ranking, but even
			very weak correlations can have strong effects.
		</p>
		<p>
			Even if your list is not enriched for multifunctional genes,
			the presence of a small number of multifunctional genes high in your
			input rankings can have profound effects on your GO enrichment
			results. The "multifunctionality correction" for the
			<a href="ora.html">ORA</a> analysis should be used to reduce the impact of
			multifunctional genes on your results.

		<h2>
			FAQs about multifunctionality
		</h2>

		<ul>
			<li>
				<strong>Is multifunctionality really a problem?</strong> It depends
				on your point of view. We think that having the results of a
				functional genomics study skewed by a small number of genes is a bad
				thing. We are not claiming that multifunctionality is incorrect or
				"bad". Genes with many functions really are biologically important,
				but in computational analyses they "distract" the algorithms from
				other genes of potential interest.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Isn't this just a problem with GO?</strong> Not really. We
				have observed the same phenomenon with KEGG and other gene
				groupings, and it's not specific to the "biological process" part of
				GO either, for example. The problem is that not every gene has the
				same number of functions. This is presumably at least partly a
				biological fact, but it is true that if every gene did have the same
				number of GO terms, the problem would go away.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Can't I just filter out the multifunctional genes?</strong>
				We don't recommend this as a preprocessing step; instead you should
				let ErmineJ help you. There is no clear separation between
				"multifunctional" and "non-multifunctional" genes. Second, highly
				multifunctional genes are important, so removing them entirely could
				be counterproductive. ErmineJ has methods to measure the impact of
				multifunctionality, and to reduct it by filtering out the most
				multifunctional genes from analyses in carefully designed ways.
