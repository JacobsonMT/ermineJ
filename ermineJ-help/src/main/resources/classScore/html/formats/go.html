			Input files:&nbsp;Gene Ontology XML
		</h1>

		<p>
			ErmineJ&nbsp;currently uses the Gene Ontology&nbsp;RDF XML* file to obtain a complete set of data about GO&nbsp;terms
			and their definitions. This file is created by the Gene Ontology team, so the file names mentioned here are subject
			to change without notice. We distribute a recent version of the required file with the ermineJ distribution (unless
			you are using the webstart version).
		</p>

		<p>
			The most recent version of the GO file should be available from the GO web site
			<a href="http://archive.geneontology.org/latest-termdb/go_daily-termdb.rdf-xml.gz">here</a>. This file can be placed
			in your ermineJ.data directory for convenience. There is no need to unzip the file.
		</p>

			If the link above is broken, go to
			<a href="http://www.godatabase.org/dev/database/">http://www.godatabase.org/dev/database/</a> and look for the
			download link -- and
			<a href="mailto:paul@bioinformatics.ubc.ca">let us know</a>.
		</p>

		<p>
			Older versions of the GO files
			<a href="http://www.godatabase.org/dev/database">should be available</a> as well. Please report problems with broken
			links on the GO web site to the GO web site maintainers or the go-database mailing list.
		</p>

		<p>
			Note that&nbsp;the&nbsp;
			<A href="annotations.html">annotation file</A> you use&nbsp;is&nbsp;not assured to be 'in synch' with the GO XML file
			you download. This matters because the GO terms change, and it is possible for an annotation file to have terms which
			are newer than the GO XML file you use.
		</p>
		<P>
			If you are using the annotation files we provide, you are advised use the GO&nbsp;XML&nbsp;file that was used during
			the latest annotation build. A link to that file is maintained at
			<a href="http://bioinformatics.ubc.ca/microannots/">http://bioinformatics.ubc.ca/microannots/</a> .
		</P>
		<P>
			If you are using an annotation file provided by a third party, or which you made yourself, we advise that you try to
			use the same version of GO that was used to created the annotations.
		</P>
