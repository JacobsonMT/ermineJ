<h1>How ermineJ stores your results</h1>

<p>When you save your results to a file from ermineJ, what you get is a
plain text file that can be opened in Excel or a similar program. Here
is a <a href="../samples/sample-savedrun.txt">sample</a>.</p>

<p>If you intend to load the results back into ermineJ at some future
point, we recommend not editing this file. Instead, make a copy after
you load it into excel.</p>

<p>The file is tab-delimited and has three parts:</p>

<ol>
	<li>A header, which contains information about the configuration used
	during analysis. This information is used by ermineJ to recreate the
	conditions that existed after the analysis was run. Most of it is
	human-readable. Currently some settings are encoded as numbers
	(e.g.,"rawScoreMethod = 0", which means that the mean of gene scores is
	taken during analysis). Future versions of ermineJ may changes this.
	Note that the number of lines in the header is not fixed and may change
	in future versions of ermineJ.</li>

	<li>Column headers, which are preceded by a "#". For explanations of
	these values, see below.</li>

	<li>The values, one row for each gene set. Note that due to numerical
	roundoff, when you reload an analysis into ermineJ you may lose some
	precision in the pvalues, for example. The</li>
</ol>


<p>The columns in the output file are:</p>

<ol>
	<li>! - a column of !'s. These are here for boring reasons explained
	below.</li>
	<li>Name - the name of the gene set</li>
	<li>ID - the id of the gene set</li>
	<li>Probes - the number of probes in the gene set ("size" in earlier
	versions)</li>
	<li>Genes - the number of genes in the gene set ("effective_size" in
	earlier versions)</li>
	<li>RawScore - the raw statistic for the gene set. For explanations see
	<a href="../tutorial/scores.html">this page</a></li>
	<li>Pval - the p value for the gene set.</li>
	<li>CorrectedPvalue - the corrected p pvalue. See <a
		href="../tutorial/mtc.html">this page</a> for more information.</li>
	<li>Same as - a list of gene sets which have the exact same members as
	this one. Such gene sets are not listed anywhere else.</li>
	<li>Similar to - Currently not used</li>
	<li>Genes - If you selected the "Include genes" option when saving,
	this will contain a list of the genes that are in the gene set,
	separated by "|".</li>
</ol>

<p>Note to programmers: ErmineJ uses Apache Commons configuration to
manage properties files. The results file is treated as a properties
file when it is reloaded, but we're only interested in the header.
Therefore lines that are not properties must be commented out. This is
why there are lines that start with # and !. We use ! instead of # to
help parsers distinguish between data lines and header lines. One of
these days we'll fix this oddity.</p>
