<h2>Multiple Test Correction in ermineJ</h2>

<p>ErmineJ uses Benjamini-Hochberg correction of p values to determine
which gene sets are selected with a false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.05.
Such sets are colored shades of green in the pval column, as shown in
the figure below. Gene sets which to not meet this criterion are not
colored.</p>

<p>Brighter shades of color indicate even lower FDRs. Currently the
colors indicate FDRs of 0.001, 0.01, 0.05 and 0.1. If you have trouble
figuring out which color is which, just look at the tooltip you get when
you point the mouse at a result, or save the results to a file - the
corrected p-values are saved in their own column.</p>

<p>Note that the color reflects the FDR when the p values for the gene
set indicated is used as the threshold. Thus it is possible for the FDR
to go up and down as you go down the list. It is not uncommon for the
FDR at very stringent thresholds to be above 0.05, while at less
stringent thresholds is can be lower. This counterintuitive result is
due to the way the FDR is computed. If you want to control the FDR at
0.05, you should pick the lowest-ranked 'blue' gene set, and all gene
sets listed above would be selected.</p>

<p>If you feel using the FDR is not appropriate, other multiple test
correction methods such as Bonferroni can be accessed from the command
line interface. You can also work with the results file you save to
compute Bonferroni or other types of corrected p values from your data.</p>
