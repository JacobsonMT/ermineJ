<h1>Searching for Gene sets</h1>

<p>ErmineJ has several facilities to make it easier to locate gene sets
of interest</p>

<p>In the main window, the menu item "GeneSets-->Find gene sets" opens a
new dialog box that helps you find gene sets of interest.</p>

<h2>Search by gene set</h2>

<p>To use it, type text you want to search for and press "Enter" on your
keyboard or click on the "Find" button. The main window is updated to
show only gene sets that match. In the example we searched for "synapse"</p>

<br>

<h2>Search by gene</h2>

<p>Alternatively, you can search by gene using the "GeneSets --> Find
gene sets by gene" menu item. Here is an example of searching for
"snap25". All gene sets containing this gene are displayed. Note that
you must enter the official gene symbol (capitalization doesn't matter).</p>

	usemap="#frame1map">
<br>
<br>

<p>In the treeview, the results of a search are indicated by greying out
all gene sets that don't meet criteria. <img border=0

<br>
<p>The 'Reset' button clears your search and shows all gene sets again.
Closing the Find window also resets the display. You can leave the Find
window open as you perform other tasks.</p>

<a name="find-user-defined" />
<h2>Where are the gene sets I defined?</h2>

<p>The key "ctrl-U" (or the corresponding menu item) toggles the display
between showing all gene sets and just the user-defined gene sets. This
is useful because the user-defined gene sets can easily get lost among
all the others!</p>

	usemap="#frame0map"> <br>
<br>

<p>Similarly, in the tree view, there is a separate subtree for
user-defined gene sets, at the bottom of the panel.</p>

<h2>How do I find gene sets in the tree?</h2>

<p>It can be hard to find a gene set in the tree because they can be anywhere in the hierarchy. Because
searches generally can yield multiple gene sets, currently the search function doesn't work the way you might
think in the tree view. Instead, locate the gene set you want in the table, and then use the context-specific
menu (right-click or option-click) to choose the "Find this set in the tree panel" option.</p>

<p>This switches you to the tree view and highlights the gene set you requested.<p>
