<h1>Tutorial: Receiver Operator Characteristic scoring</h1>

<h2>Method Overview</h2>

<p>The receiver operator characteristic (ROC) method is a&nbsp;fast,
non-parametric&nbsp;alternative to the ORA and resampling methods for
generating gene set scores from gene scores.</p>
<P>The ROC is a well-known method for evaluating rankings of items, in
this case genes. The ranking in this case comes from the gene scores. A
gene set will get a good ROC if many genes in the gene set are near the
top of the list.</P>

<p>The score measured for each gene set is the area under the ROC curve,
a value between 0 and 1. If the genes in the gene set are randomly
distributed in the ranking, you would expect a value near 0.5. Values
near 1 indicate the genes in the gene set are near the top of the list,
while&nbsp; values near 0 indicate the genes in the gene set are near
the bottom of the list. In principle both values near 0 and near 1 are
statistically significant, but p-values reported by ermineJ are based on
the assumption that only the top of the list is of interest (e.g., we're
not&nbsp;&nbsp;considering "under-representation analysis").</p>

<p>Unlike the other methods in ermineJ, the ROC uses only the ranks of
the gene scores. That is, all it cares about is the ordering of items
obtained by your gene scores (e.g., t-test or fold-change), but doesn't
use the information about the relative values of the scores.</p>

<p>Like other non-parametric techniques,&nbsp;using ranks costs some
power, but also makes fewer assumptions. Specifically, if you think the
ordering of items in your data is more accurate than the actual p-values
themselves, the ROC might be appropriate.</p>

<p>P-values for this analysis are computed using algorithms described in
Breslin et al., 2004*. For more information on the ROC, you could do
worse than reading the Wikipedia page (<a

<h2>Walkthrough</h2>

<p>If you have read the <A href="ora.html">ORA</A> page (please do), you
will recognize the first 5 steps of the wizard. The only different one
is the last step, where the only difference is no p-value threshold is
needed.</p>

<p>There is another explanation of gene scores <A href="scores.html">here</A>.</p>
