<h1>Tutorial: Gene score resampling (GSR)</h1>

<h2>Overview of the method</h2>

<p>The goal of this method is the same as for ORA: to provide a p value
for each gene set. The key difference lies in that ORA requires that you
select a threshold for "gene selection", whereas GSR does not.</p>

<p>GSR uses all the gene scores for the genes in a gene set to produce a
score. This means that genes that do not meet a statistical threshold
for selection can contribute to the score. In addition, more information
contained in the gene scores is preserved than in ORA, because ORA is
essentially rank-based, whereas GSR uses the gene scores themselves.</p>

<p>In practice, ORA and GSR can yield similar results; however, we have
found that GSR tends to be more robust than ORA (because there is no
threshold to set) and can give interesting results in situations where
ORA doesn't work as well (when no genes meet the predetermined selection
threshold).</p>

<p>A high-level overview of the procedure is depicted below.</p>

<p>An illustration of the distribution obtained by resampling, and how a
p value is computed, is shown below:</p>

<p><img alt="" src="../images/random-score-distribution.gif" border="0"></p>

<p>The red line is a cumulative probability distribution for the
randomly sampled gene sets. You can see that raw scores over 2.00 are
quite unlikely. In this example the gene set "protein kinase regulator
activity" had a raw score of about 2.2. This yields a p value of about
0.00019 (the height of the red graph at that point). If the gene set had
a score of 1.5, the p value would be poor (about 0.4).</p>

<h2>Walk-through</h2>

<p>The steps for the resampling analysis are the same as for <a
	href="ora.html">ORA</a>, except for the last step.</p>

<p>As for ORA, you must decide whether to take the negative logarithm of
the gene scores or not, and whether "larger" genes scores are considered
"good".</p>

<p><b>Tip:</b> If you are using raw p values as your gene scores, check
the "log transform" box, and leave the "larger scores are better" box
unchecked. This is because the "larger is better" choice relates to the
original threshold, not the log-tranformed threshold. On the other hand,
if your p-values are already -log-transformed, you should use the exact
opposite settings.</p>

<h3>Log transformation</h3>

<p>If you negative log-transform the gene scores, then your input gene
scores are transformed according to the function f(x) = -<em>log<sub>10</sub></em>(x).
This option is provided as a convenience as the most common type of gene
score is a p-value. The transform f(x) puts the p values on a more
useful scale. However, you should still leave the "larger scores are
better" box unchecked, as this refers to your original data.</p>

<h3>Are larger scores better?</h3>

<p>If you are using <em>fold change</em> as your gene scores, you may
want to check the "larger scores are better" box. This assumes that you
have taken the absolute value of the fold change values before entering
them into ermineJ. That way, changes up and down will be considered
equally. Alternatively, you could focus on changes up or down by
retaining the sign on the fold change values and setting this option
depending on which direction of change you are interested in analyzing.</p>


<p>There is another explanation of gene scores <a href="scores.html">here</a>.</p>

<h3>How many iterations?</h3>

<p>Unlike ORA, you must choose how many iterations to run. To speed
things up, you can uncheck the "Always use full resampling" checkbox,
which enables some <a href="approximations.html">approximations</a> .
Alternatively, we suggest a starting value of 10,000 iterations. When
you decide on parameters you like, we recommend a larger number of
iterations (perhaps 200,000 or more). This is to get sufficient
precision in the p-values to make multiple-test correction work
correctly.</p>

ORA, the results will take a short while to compute. As the</p>
