<h1>Viewing, defining and modifying gene sets</h1>

<p>A <b>gene set</b>&nbsp;is any grouping of genes defined by criteria
other than the data currently being analyzed. Our baseline gene sets are
defined using Gene Ontology terms as applied in the publicly available
sources listed on the GO web site.</p>

<p>You can view, import, define, or modify gene sets as you like, using
the "gene set" menu on the main panel of the software. This page
explains how.</p>

<h2><a name="viewgeneset"></a>Viewing a gene set</h2>

<p>When the software first starts, the gene sets are defined by the
microarray annotation file you uploaded. Prior to doing any analysis, or
at any other time, you can view the list of genes in a gene set in one
of three ways.</p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<div>You can "right click" on the gene set name and select "View/Modify
	gene set". You will be shown the details for that gene set in a new
	window. If you are just looking, and don't want to modify the gene set,
	just hit cancel when you are done.</div>
	</li>

	<li>
	<div>You can select the "View/Modify gene set" from the analysis menu.
	In this case you then select which gene set to view.</div>
	</li>

	<li>You can double-click on the gene set name to bring up the <a
		href="visualize.html">visualization</a> of the gene set</li>
</ol>

<p>The first two options are appropriate if you want to modify the gene
set.</p>

<h2>Creating a new gene set from scratch</h2>

<p>Select "create new gene set" from the "gene set"&nbsp;menu. This gets
you to the new gene set wizard.</p>

<p>You can import a file describing a gene set, or you can create one
manually from the list of genes on the array you are using. You choose
which to use by selecting "file" or "manual"&nbsp;in the first step of
the new gene set wizard:</p>

<br>
<br>

<h2>Adding new genes manually</h2>

<p>Select probes from the left panel and click "add"&nbsp;to move them
to the right panel. Note that here we added one probe for the ABCA1
gene, but four probes were moved to the right. This is because there are
four probes which assay ABCA1; all of them are added to the gene set
automatically. Similarly you can delete probes from the right panel by
using the 'delete' button.</p>

<br>
<br>

<h3>Using the 'find' function to help locate genes.</h3>

<p>To make it easier to build new gene sets, a 'find' function is
provided. Here we searched for "cell cycle".</p>

	usemap="#frame0map">
<br>
<br>

<h3>Giving the new gene set a name and description</h3>

<p>After adding the probes and genes to the gene set and hitting "next",
you will be asked to enter a new identifier and description for the gene
set you defined. When you hit finish, the information about this gene
set is saved to disk and you are returned to the main panel.</p>


<img border=0 src="newGeneSet_files\newGeneSet2.png" usemap="#frame2map">
<br>
<br>

<p>After hitting 'finish', the new gene set is shown in color in the
output panel. The gene set is also saved to disk for future use. The
format and file locations are described <a
	href="../formats/geneset.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>If you can't see the new gene set on the output panel, press "Ctrl-U"
to hide all but the user-defined gene sets. Hitting "Ctrl-U" again shows
all the gene sets.</p>

<h2>Entering a gene set from a file</h2>

<p>Gene sets can be loaded in from files created by the user. For
details on the format, see <a href="../formats/geneset.html">this page</a>.
But basically it is just a list of genes, one per row.</p>

<p>Select the "Load from file" option:</p>

<img border=0 src="loadGeneSet_files\loadGeneSet0.png"
	usemap="#frame0map">
<br>
<br>

<p>After loading a gene set, you will be able to check modify it before
giving it a name and saving it to disk.</p>

	usemap="#frame1map">
<br>
<br>


<h2>Modifying an existing gene set</h2>

<p>You can modify a pre-existing gene set by adding or removing genes.
This is done using the "Modify gene set" wizard. This can be accessed
either by right-clicking on the gene set in the Output Panel or by
selecting the "modify" item from the Gene set menu.</p>

<p>If you use the "Gene set" menu, you will get a list of all the
available gene sets. Select one by clicking on it. You can use the find
function to help locate a specific set. After this step, the procedure
is very similar to the "create new" gene set procedure explained above.</p>

<img border=0 src="modifyGeneSet_files\modifyGeneSet0.png"
	usemap="#frame0map">
<br>
<br>


<p>The next screen lists the available probes on the left, and the
probes in the set on the right. Similar to the 'create new gene set'
procedure shown above, you can add or remove probes.</p>


<img border=0 src="modifyGeneSet_files\modifyGeneSet2.png"
	usemap="#frame2map">
<br>
<br>

<p>Finally, you can provide your gene set with a new name. This is
actually optional:&nbsp;if you don't provide a new name, the old gene
set will simply be replaced.</p>

<img border=0 src="modifyGeneSet_files\modifyGeneSet3.png"
	usemap="#frame3map">
<br>
<br>

<p><strong>Note!</strong>: If you rename a Gene Ontology gene set, next
time you start the software, your redefined gene set will always replace
the one defined in the GO XML file. See below</p>

<p>As for new gene sets, the modified gene sets are shown on the main
panel in a different color to indicate they were modified by the user.
Use "ctrl-U" to make them show up on their own, or look in the
"user-defined" section of the tree panel.</p>

<img border=0
	src="userDefinedGeneSetsInMainPanel_files\userDefinedGeneSetsInMainPanel0.png"
	usemap="#frame0map">
<br>
<br>

<img border=0
	src="userDefinedGeneSetsInMainPanel_files\userDefinedGeneSetsInMainPanel1.png"
	usemap="#frame1map">
<br>
<br>

<h2>I don't like my gene set, how do I get rid of it?</h2>

<p>You can delete user-defined gene sets using the popup menu in the
table or tree view. If you delete a class that is part of the gene
ontology (only possible if you modified it), it will disappear for this
session, but will be reloaded from the GO XML file next time you start
up ermineJ.</p>

<p>Alternatively, find the place where ermineJ stores gene sets and
delete the files by hand.</p>
