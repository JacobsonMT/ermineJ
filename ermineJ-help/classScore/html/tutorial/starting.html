<h1>Using ermineJ for the first time</h1>

<p>This page introduces what you will see when you first run ermineJ.
Details on how to <a href="analysis.html">run an analysis</a>, <a
	href="visualize.html">view the details of a gene set</a> and other
tasks are detailed elsewhere.</p>

<p>Before you begin you will need to get some files the software uses.
First, you need a file that describes what gene sets are available.
ErmineJ is set up to use the Gene Ontology; the necessary file is
provided with the software but you may want to keep it up to date. The
other file is one that describes the microarray design you are using:
which of the Gene Ontology terms are actually represented on the
microarray.</p>

<P>For more information on these input files, see the "<A
	href="../formats/go.html">Gene Ontology&nbsp;XML</A>" topic and the "<A
	href="../formats/annotations.html">Gene Annotation</A>" topic.</P>

<p>After you have obtained the files (unzipping them is not necessary),
you can return to this page.</p>

<p>When you first start up the software, you will be presented with the
following dialog box (Note that most of the screen shots in this manual
have been scaled down to save space).</p>

<a name="link0"></a>
<map name="frame0map">
</map>
<img border=0 src="startingUp_files/startingUp0.png" usemap="#frame0map">
<br>
<br>

<p>Enter the GO XML file you are using, and the microarray annotation
file, using the "Browse" buttons to locate them on your computer. Select
the format of the annotation file from the pull-down menu. If you got
the file from our web site, the format is "ErmineJ". The click on
"Start".</p>

<p>Then you will have a brief wait while the data files are loaded.
These data are used for the remaining analysis and will only have to be
loaded once. Here is what the loading screen looks like:</p>

<a name="link1"></a>
<map name="frame1map">
</map>
<img border=0 src="startingUp_files/startingUp1.png" usemap="#frame1map">
<br>
<br>

<p>Once loading is finished (~15-30 seconds) the following "table view"
is shown.</p>


<a name="link2"></a>
<map name="frame2map">
</map>
<img border=0 src="startingUp_files/startingUp2.png" usemap="#frame2map">
<br>
<br>

<p>The three key parts of this window are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The "output panel" listing available gene sets either in a table or
	in a tree (see below).</li>
	<li>The menu bar, which is used to access analyses and other functions</li>
	<li>The "status bar" at the bottom of the window that is used to
	display pertinent information.</li>
</ul>


<p>The menus are:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<div><STRONG>File</STRONG> - currently only used to quit the program.</div>
	<li>
	<div><STRONG>Gene sets</STRONG> - used to <A href="classes.html">modify
	or create new gene sets</A> as well as <a href="findGeneSet.html">search
	for gene sets</a>. A menu item is available to reload the user-defined
	gene sets, which can be useful if new ones have been added or you have
	edited the files.</div>
	<li><STRONG>Analysis</STRONG> - used to <A href="analysis.html">run
	analyses</A>, <a href="loadsave.html">load or save</a>. Also to cancel
	an analysis while it is running. Finally, you can set the raw data file
	and gene score file. This is also settable from the <a
		href="analysis.html">analysis wizard</a> and in the <a
		href="visualize">details view</a> for a gene set</li>
	<li>
	<div><STRONG>Results</STRONG> - Used to switch the results set shown in
	the tree view. It will be inactive if you are viewing the table view or
	have done fewer than 2 analyses.</div>
	</li>
	<li>
	<div><STRONG>Help</STRONG> - used to reach these pages and view
	credits. You can also view the log file, which can be useful when
	reporting problems with the software.</div>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>There are shortcut keys for many of the menu items.</p>

<p>There are some additional features of the interface described <a
	href="#addfeats">below</a>.</p>

<h2>Table view</h2>

<p>The table view always shows the four columns (and others, once you
have done some analysis); clicking on a column header will re-sort the
table according to the selected column.</p>

<p><strong>Note that GO terms with no members in your array design, or
more than 2000 members, are not displayed on the table.</strong></p>

<p>The table's columns are:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<div><STRONG>Name</STRONG> - the name or ID number of the gene set.</div>
	<li>
	<div><STRONG>Description</STRONG> - the description of the gene set</div>
	<li>
	<div><STRONG>Probes</STRONG> - how many probes on the array are in the
	gene set (We use the term "probe" to mean a "probe set" on Affymetrix
	arrays). This value is always the number of probes on the array design,
	even if your data set (which has not been entered yet) has filtered out
	some of the results.&nbsp; See this <a href="numitems.html">note</a> .</div>
	<li>
	<div><STRONG>Genes</STRONG> - how many genes are in the gene set. This
	value is always less than or equal to the number of probes, because
	some genes are represented by more than one probe on the
	array.&nbsp;This value is always the number of genes represented in the
	array design, even if your&nbsp;data set (which has not been entered
	yet) has filtered out some of the results. See this <a
		href="numitems.html">note</a>.</div>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>After an analysis has been done, additional columns will be added to
this table. These are explained <a href="analysis.html">elsewhere</a>.</p>


<a name="treeview" />
<h2>The tree view</h2>

<p>The "tree" tab switches you to a view of the gene sets in a
hierarchy. This view is linked to the table view in many ways. You can
use either or both views, depending on what you are doing and which you
prefer.</p>

<a name="link3"></a> <map name="frame3map">
</map> <img border=0 src="startingUp_files/startingUp3.png"
	usemap="#frame3map"> <br>
<br>

<p>In the the tree panel, the entire Gene Ontology is displayed, along
with gene sets you have defined (under "user-defined").</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> GO terms not listed on the table view are
shown in grey italic text.</p>


<a name="addfeat"></a>
<h2>Additional functionality of the main panel</h2>

<p>In addition to the obvious features shown above, there are other
functionalities of the main panel:</p>

<h3>Mouse button actions</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Double-clicking on a gene set in either the table or tree brings up
	the <a href="visualize">details view</a> for that gene set.</li>
	<li>On both the tree and table view, there is a "popup" or
	"context-specific" menu (right-click on windows, option-click on Mac)
	for gene sets that makes it easier to use common functions and search
	the Gene Ontology web site. There is a different popup menu for
	different parts of the table and some functions are only available from
	the tree view or the table view.</li>
	<li>Clicking on the table headers resorts the table.</li>
</ul>

<a name="tooltips" />
<h3>Tooltips</h3>

<p>There are <strong>"tooltips"</strong> that are used to display extra
information that would otherwise clutter up the interface. Hover the
mouse over a field in the table or a line in the tree to see this.
Specifically:</p>

<ul>
	<li>On both the tree and table views, hovering over a gene set ID or
	name brings up a tooltip that shows the GO aspect and definition (if
	any).</li>

	<li>In the table view, hovering over a result p-value shows detailed
	statistics (when you first start the software there are no results
	columns, so this will make more sense once <a href="ora.html">you do</a>).
	The score that is shown is <a href="scores.html"> explained here</a></li>

	<li>In the table view, hovering over the header of a results column
	shows a summary of the settings that were used</li>
</ul>

</ul>
