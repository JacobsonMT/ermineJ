<h1>Using ermineJ for the first time</h1>

<p>This page introduces what you will see when you first run ermineJ.
Details on how to <a href="analysis.html">run an analysis</a>, <a
	href="visualize.html">view the details of a gene set</a> and other
tasks are detailed elsewhere.</p>

<p>Before you begin you will need to get some files the software uses.
First, you need a file that describes what gene sets are available.
ErmineJ is set up to use the Gene Ontology; the necessary file is
provided with the software but you may want to keep it up to date. The
other file is one that describes the microarray design you are using:
which of the Gene Ontology terms are actually represented on the
microarray.</p>

<P>For more information on these input files, see the "<A
	href="../formats/go.html">Gene Ontology&nbsp;XML</A>" topic and the "<A
	href="../formats/annotations.html">Gene Annotation</A>" topic.</P>

<p>After you have obtained and unzipped the files, you can return to
this page.</p>

<p>When you first start up the software, you will be presented with the
following dialog box (most of the screen shots in this manual have been
shrunk).
<p>Enter the GO XML file you are using, and the microarray annotation
file, using the "Browse" buttons to locate them on your computer. Select
the format of the annotation file from the pull-down menu. If you got
the file from our web site, the format is "ErmineJ". The click on
"Start".</p>

<map name="frame0map">

<br>
<br>


<p>Then you will have a brief wait while the data files are loaded.
These data are used for the remaining analysis and will only have to be
loaded once. Here is what the loading screen looks like:</p>

<a name="link1"></a>
<map name="frame1map">
</map>
<img border=0 src="startingUp_files\startingUp1.png" usemap="#frame1map">
<br>
<br>

<p>Once loading is finished (~15-30 seconds) the following window is
shown.</p>

<p>The three key parts of this window are the "output panel' listing all
the available gene sets either in a table or in a tree (see below), the
menu bar, which is used to perform analyses and other functions, and a
"status bar" at the bottom of the window that is used to display
pertinent information.</p>



<a name="link2"></a>
<map name="frame2map">
</map>
<img border=0 src="startingUp_files\startingUp2.png" usemap="#frame2map">
<br>
<br>


<p>The Output panel always shows the four columns (and others, once you
have done some analysis); clicking on a column header will re-sort the
table according to the selected column.</p>

<p>The columns are:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<div><STRONG>Name</STRONG> - the name or ID number of the gene set.</div>
	<li>
	<div><STRONG>Description</STRONG> - the description of the gene set</div>
	<li>
	<div><STRONG>Probes</STRONG> - how many probes on the array are in the
	gene set (We use the term "probe" to mean a "probe set" on Affymetrix
	arrays). This value is always the number of probes on the array design,
	even if your data set (which has not been entered yet) has filtered out
	some of the results.&nbsp; See this <a href="numitems.html">note</a>
	.FIXME</div>
	<li>
	<div><STRONG>Genes</STRONG> - how many genes are in the gene set. This
	value is always less than or equal to the number of probes, because
	some genes are represented by more than one probe on the
	array.&nbsp;This value is always the number of genes represented in the
	array design, even if your&nbsp;data set (which has not been entered
	yet) has filtered out some of the results. See this <a
		href="numitems.html">note</a> .FIXME</div>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>After an analysis has been done, additional columns will be added to
this table. These are explained elsewhere.</p>

<p>The menus are:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<div><STRONG>File</STRONG> - currently only used to quit the program.</div>
	<li>
	<div><STRONG>Gene sets</STRONG> - used to <A href="classes.html">modify
	or create new gene sets</A> as well as <a href="findGeneSet.html">search
	for gene sets</a>.</div>
	<li>
	<div><STRONG>Analysis</STRONG> - used to <A href="analysis.html">run
	analyses</A>, <a href="loadsave.html">load or save</a>. Also to cancel
	an analysis while it is running.</div>
	<li>
	<div><STRONG>Results</STRONG> - Used to switch the results set shown in
	the tree view. It will be inactive if you are viewing the table view or
	have done fewer than 2 analyses.</div>
	</li>
	<li>
	<div><STRONG>Help</STRONG> - used to reach these pages and view
	credits.</div>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>There are shortcut keys for many of the menu items.</p>

<p>The "tree" tab switches you to a view of the gene sets in a
hierarchy. This view is linked to the table view in many ways. You can
use either or both views, depending on what you are doing and which you
prefer.</p>

<h2>Additional functionality of the main panel</h2>

<p>In addition to the obvious features shown above, there are other
functionalities of the main panel:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Double-clicking on a gene set in either the table or tree brings up
	the <a href="visualize">details view</a> for that gene set.</li>
	<li>On both the tree and table view, there is a context-specific menu
	(right-click on windows, option-click on Mac) for gene sets that makes
	it easier to use common functions and search the Gene Ontology web site</li>
	<li>Clicking on the table headers resorts the table.</li>
	<li>On both the tree and table views, hovering over a gene set ID or
	name brings up a "tooltip" that shows the GO aspect and definition (if
	any).</li>
</ul>
