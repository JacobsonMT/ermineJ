<h1>Running an analysis and using the output panel</h1>

<p>To run an analysis, choose "run analysis" from the analysis menu.</p>

<p>The first screen you are presented with is this one:</p>

<p><IMG height="284" alt="" src="../images/analysis1.JPG" width="418"
	border="0"></p>

<p>Choose the type of analysis you want to do. Directions on the
specific types of analysis are available:</p>

<ul> 
	<li>
	<div><A href="ora.html">ORA</A>&nbsp; - start here to read general
	information about conducting an analysis.</div>
	<li>
	<div><A href="resampling.html">Gene score resampling</A></div>
	<li>
	<div><A href="correlation.html">Correlation</A></div>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>(the rest of this tutorial assumes you have run some analysis using
the directions)</p>

<p>When you are done with an analysis, the output panel will show the
results. Here is the output panel after an analysis. Note that the
"Probes" and "Genes" columns show how many probe and genes are on the
array design, not necessarily the number represented in your data.
Please read this <A href="numitems.html">note</A> for more explanation.
To get the number used in the analysis, hover your the mouse pointer
over the results column and read the sizes from the tool tip.</p>

<p>The results of each run are shown in columns after the standard four.
Each value is the p value associated with the gene set for that run.
Rows that have "good" pvalues are shown in color. (the specific meaning
of the colors is subject to change: currently only gene sets that meet a
<a href="mtc.html">FDR</a> of 0.1 are in color.)</p>

<p>If you hold the mouse over a p-value for a gene set, a tool tip will
be displayed that shows additional information, including the correct
number of probes and genes for the gene set as represented in the data
you used.</p>

<p>The colors indicate classes that passed a multiple test correction.
Read details <A href="mtc.html">here</A>.</p>

<h2>The tree panel</h2>

<p>Selecting the tree panel lets you view the results of the analysis in
another way:</p>

<img border=0 src="afterAnalysis_files/afterAnalysis1.png"
	usemap="#frame1map">
<br>
<br>

<p>Gene sets that appear in grey are not represented on your microarray
design, or have been excluded <a href="findgenesets.html">by a search</a>.</p>

<p>The green color-coding has the same meaning as for the table panel -
it indicates gene sets that have "good" pvalues. (the specific meaning
of the colors is subject to change: currently only gene sets that meet a
<a href="mtc.html">FDR</a> of 0.1 are in color.)</p>

<p>The icons also have specific meaning to help you find interesting
reuslts more quickly (Note: the icons may change in future versions of
the software. This description is meant to be general:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Yellow spots indicate that the gene set has a "good" pvalue (it
	would be shown in color).</li>
	<li>Purple diamonds indicate that the gene set has a child that has a
	"good" pvalue.</li>
	<li>Yellow spots with a purple center indicate that the gene set has a
	good pvalue AND it has a child that has a good pvalue.</li>
	<li>Blue squares indicate a gene set that has no children with good
	pvalues.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Selecting the analysis in the tree view</h3>

<p>After an analysis is run, the results of the new analysis are shown
in the tree. To switch to a different analysis, use the "Results" menu
and select the run you would like to view. If you have done fewer than
two analyses, the "Results" menu will be greyed out.</p>

<h2>Deleting a run</h2>

<p>You can <strong>delete a run by right-clicking on its column
heading&nbsp;</strong> and selecting "delete this run". <strong>Note</strong>:
A known issue is that the table will resort itself after doing this;
just click on a header to resort it the way you want.</p>

<h2>Renaming a run</h2>

<p>You can <strong>Rename a run</strong> by right-clicking on its column
heading and selecting "rename this run". This can be convenient if you
have a lot of runs.</p>

<h2>Viewing the details of a gene set</h2>

<p>You can <strong>double-click on a row</strong> to get the details for
a gene set. For example, to view the details for run 2, "response to
hypoxia", click on the cell in the "Run 2 Pval" column on the "response
to hypoxia" row. The window you get is explained <A
	href="visualize.html">here</A>.</p>

<h2>View information about a gene set on the GO web site</h2>

<p>By <strong>right-clicking on a row</strong>, you will get&nbsp;a
pop-up menu. The first item on this menu should open a web browser
showing the <a
	href="http://www.godatabase.org/cgi-bin/amigo/go.cgi?search_constraint=terms&amp;action=replace_tree">Amigo</a>
web page for the gene set selected.</p>

<p>The other menu item allows you to <A href="classes.html">view or
modify the gene set</A>.</p>
