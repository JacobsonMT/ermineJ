<h2>Tutorial: General analysis steps and Over-representation analysis
(ORA)</h2>

<p>We suggest that you read this page first, as it explains some aspects
of analysis that are common to all the methods.</p>

<h2>Overview of the method</h2>

<p>Over-representation analysis (ORA) examines the genes that meet a
selection criterion and determines if there are gene sets which are
statistically over-represented. This method differs from the
resampling-based analysis in that you must set a gene score threshold
for gene selection. The software does not support entering a list of
selected genes. Instead, you input the list of all genes along with
their scores, and set the threshold.</p>

<p>The probabilities produced by ermineJ ORA are computed using the
binomal approximation to the hypergeometric distribution.</p>

<h2>Walkthrough</h2>

<p><strong>Step 1</strong> is to choose the type of analysis. We select
ORA:</p>

<h3>Step 2: choose input file(s)</h3>

<p>The next window is common to all analysis methods. Two data files are
requested. For ORA, only the Gene Score File is required. However,
entering the raw data file will allow you to visualize the results
later.</p>

<p>The Gene Score file format is explained <a
	href="../formats/genescores.html">here.</a> &nbsp;In this panel, you
must also select the score column. The first column in the gene score
file contains the probe identifiers; the gene scores themselves are in
the second or higher column. If your gene score file only has two
columns, just use the default value of 2.</p>

<p>The Raw data file format is explained <a
	href="../formats/microarray.html">here</a> .</p>

<h3>Step 3: Choose custom gene sets to include</h3>

<p>This, also common to all analysis methods, asks you to add any custom
gene sets you may have defined.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Choose GO aspects</h3>

<p><strong>Step 4</strong> is also common to all the methods. Select the
GO aspects you want to include in the analysis.</p>

<p><strong>Step 5</strong> is also common to all the methods.</p>

<p>The <strong>maximum and minimum gene set sizes</strong> determine the
range of gene set sizes that will be considered. We recommend avoiding
the use of very small or very large gene sets. There are several reasons
to avoid using extremes:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<div>The more gene sets you examine, the worse the multiple testing
	issue.</div>
	</li>

	<li>
	<div>Using more gene sets increases computation time for the
	resamping-based methods (not an issue for ORA).</div>
	</li>

	<li>
	<div>Very large or very small gene sets are less informative:</div>
	</li>

	<li style="LIST-STYLE-TYPE: none">
	<ul>
		<li>
		<div>Very large gene sets are rather non-specific and tend not to tell
		you as much.</div>
		</li>

		<li>
		<div>Very small gene sets defeat the purpose of examining genes in
		groups.</div>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>The "<strong>Gene replicate treatment</strong> " refers to what is
done when a gene occurs more than once in the dataset.</p>

<p>There are two options, "Best" and "Mean". The application of these
methods differs for the different methods. There is more information <a
	href="genereps">here</a></p>

<h3>Step 6: ORA-specific settings</h3>

<p>This step is specific to the ORA analysis.</p>

<p>The gene score threshold determines how genes are "selected". Genes
that meet the threshold requirement are considered "good". ErmineJ
operates differently from some other available tools in that you do not
enter the "good" genes yourself: the software selects them based on the
criteria you set here.</p>

<p><b>Tip:</b> If you are using raw p values as your gene scores, make
sure your threshold is a value between 0 and 1 (e.g., 0.0001), check the
"log transform" box, and leave the "larger scores are better" box
unchecked. This is because the "larger is better" choice relates to the
original threshold, not the log-tranformed threshold. On the other hand,
if your p-values are already -log-transformed, you should use the exact
opposite settings.</p>

<h3>Log transformation</h3>

<p>If you negative log-transform the gene scores, then your input gene
scores are transformed according to the function f(x) = -<em>log<sub>10</sub></em>(x).
This option is provided as a convenience as the most common type of gene
score is a p-value. The transform f(x) puts the p values on a more
useful scale. However, you should still leave the "larger scores are
better" box unchecked, as this refers to your original data.</p>

<h3>Are larger gene scores better?</h3>

<p>If you are using fold change as your gene scores, you may want to
check the "larger scores are better" box. This assumes that you have
taken the absolute value of the fold change values before entering them
into ermineJ. That way, changes up and down will be considered equally.
Alternatively, you could focus on changes up or down by retaining the
sign on the fold change values and setting this option depending on
which direction of change you are interested in analyzing.</p>

<p>After hitting finish, you will rapidly get a new result set in the
output (results) table. This is explained <a href="afterAnalysis.html">here</a></p>
