<h1>Gene set scores</h1>

<p>During analysis, each gene set is given a score. These scores appear
in the <a href="../formats/saved-data.html">output file</a> as well as
in the <a href="starting.html#tooltips">tooltips</a> for the table view.</p>

<p>This score is used to compute a p-value for each gene set. Because
the size of a gene set must be taken into account as well, there is no
simple relationship between a score and a pvalue, though higher scores
will be better. This has several important implications:</p>

<ol>
	<li>This means that <strong>the gene set score should not be used in
	isolation to evaluate the significance of a gene set</strong>. It is
	displayed for your information.</li>
	<li>Two gene sets of different sizes will have different pvalues for
	the same score</li>
	<li>The ranking of gene scores will not be the same as the ranking of p
	values</li>
</ol>


<p>The meaning of the score depends on the type of analysis:</p>

<ol>
	<li>ORA: Gene set score = the number of genes in the gene set above the
	threshold you set for the <em>gene score</em>. (Note: this may be
	changed to the fraction of genes above the threshold in future version
	of ermineJ)</li>
	<li>Resampling: Either the mean or median of the gene scores for the
	genes in the gene set.</li>
	<li>Correlation: The mean value of the absolute value of the
	correlation between all pairs of genes in the gene set.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<p><strong>ORA</strong>: Say your gene score threshold is 0.001 and that
selects 50 genes. Say some gene set has 30 genes, of which 3 are in the
50 genes you selected. The score displayed will be 3.</p>

<p><strong>Resampling</strong>: For the same gene set of 50 genes, say
the mean (log-transformed, negated) p-value is 2. That means that the
geometric mean p-value is 0.01. The gene set score is 2.</p>

<p><strong>Correlation</strong>: For that same gene set, we measure the
correlation between each pair of genes, a value that can vary from -1 to
1. We use the absolute value, yielding values from 0 to 1. The average
of this value is the gene set score. (comparisons of a gene to itself
are not included).</p>
