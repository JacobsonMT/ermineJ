<h1>Tutorial: Correlation resampling</h1>

<h2>Method Overview</h2>

<p>Unlike ORA and Gene Score Resampling, this method examines the gene
expression profiles themselves, not the gene scores for each gene. A
score is computed for a gene set based on how correlated the expression
profiles are.</p>

<p>This can be thought of as a measure of how well the genes in the set
cluster together, but they need not all be in the same cluster. Thus a
gene set that contains two coherent clusters that encompass most of the
genes in the set will tend to get a good score (though not as good as a
gene set that is just one big cluster).</p>


<h2>When to use correlation scoring</h2>

<p>If you are interested in gene clustering, as opposed to simply
looking at differntial expression, this method is appropriate. If you
feel limited by the choice of distance metrics in ermineJ, <a
	href="ora.html">ORA</a> would be an alternative, but you have to define
distinct clusters of genes to do that.</p>

<p>One alternative use of correlation scoring is as a control for
gene-score-based analysis. Correlated gene sets can cause spurious high
scores, especially if the differential expression in your study is weak.
To use this approach, you could first use gene-score-based analysis
(e.g., <a href="resampling.html">gene score resampling</a> and then
analyze the data using correlation analysis. If any of your gene sets
have high scores in both analyses, you should look at the data to see if
the correlation is not associated with the differential expression. This
is a simple (but ad hoc) alternative to using resampling over the
samples to do the gene-score-based analysis.</p>


<h2>Walkthrough</h2>

<p>If you have read the <a href="ora.html">ORA</a> page (please do), you
will recognize the first 5 steps of the wizard. The only different one
is the last step:</p>

<p><font color="#990000"><strong>Note</strong></font> that the "gene
replicate treatment" choice in step 5 does not apply to correlation
analysis at this time. All correlation analyses use the "mean" method of
weighting multiple comparisons among genes. Comparisons of a gene to
itself are always skipped. That is, if there are two probes for a gene,
they are not compared.</p>

<p>Correlation resampling is the most computationally intensive method
implemented by ermineJ. For this reason we recommend setting the number
of iterations lower, perhaps only 10,000. In addition, running larger
class sizes takes longer than smaller ones, a consideration you might
use when setting the parameters.</p>
