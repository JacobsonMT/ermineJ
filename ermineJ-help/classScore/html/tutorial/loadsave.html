<h1>Saving and loading analyses</h1>

<p>You can save an analysis you did and load it again later.</p>

<p>These capabilities are accessed in the main window using the
"Analysis" menu.</p>

<h2>Saving:</h2>

<p><img alt="" src="../images/save_analysis.gif" border="0"></p>

<p>You can also optionally check a box to "include all genes" in the
output. If you select that, each line in the output file will include a
list of genes which are in the gene set.</p>

<p>The output format is described <a href="../formats/saved-data.html">here</a></p>

<h2>Loading an analysis</h2>

<p>Once you have saved an analysis, you can load it back in using the
"Analysis -> load analysis" item:</p>

<p><img alt="" src="../images/loadanalysis.gif" border="0"></p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The locations of files (on your hard drive)
used during the analysis are stored in header of the results file. If
you move those files (such as the gene score file), reading the analysis
back in might not work. In some cases you will be prompted to enter the
new locations of the files but to be safe, leave the files where they
were when you did the analysis and you won't have this problem. Another
option is to edit the header of the results file to reflect the new
location, but this is not recommended.</p>

<p>If you delete the files referred to in the header, you will
definitely have problems loading the analysis back in! (though the
results file is still usable in other software such as excel).</p>
