<h1>File information: gene annotations</h1>

<p>You can use two types of annotation files, ones we provide on our web
site, or ones provided by Affymetrix for their microarray platforms.
Requests for support of other formats will gladly be entertained. You
can also use files you have created, so long as they follow one of the
accepted formats.</p>

<p>You inform ermineJ of which format you are using with the pull-down
menu used at startup.</p>

<p>As of version 2.1, the files can be gzipped or zipped. There is no
need to unpack them.</p>

<h2>Using files we provide</h2>

<p>In ermineJ, we refer to these as "ermineJ format", but the files are
very simple and useful in other contexts</p>

<p>You can <a href="http://microarray.genomecenter.columbia.edu/annots/">download
annotation files here</a> (http://microarray.cpmc.columbia.edu/annots/).
<strong>Note:</strong> For ermineJ, we recommend using the annotation
files that have "No parents" (parent terms are not listed explicitly in
the file). This is because ermineJ rapidly computes parents for each
term when you load the file. Using the "No parents" versions will result
in faster startup times for ermineJ.</p>

<p>We provide annotation files for some popular (and some
not-so-popular) array formats. These files contain the probe (or probe
set)&nbsp;identifiers, the gene symbols and names, and gene set
membership information. For our current annotations, this means that a
list of the Gene Ontology terms associated with a gene are listed. For
each term, the 'parent' terms are also listed, so that genes associated
with very specific terms are also included in the less specific
categories.</p>

<p>For species or platforms we don't support, ask us for assistance or
set it up yourself. The files are not hard to prepare if you have Gene
Ontology (or other gene set descriptor) annotations available.</p>

<p>For species we support, but for new platforms, often you will be able
to create a new annotation file by pulling information out of our
existing files using a simple Perl script.</p>

<h3>Description of the format</h3>

<ul>
<li>The file is tab-delimited text. Comma-delimited files or Excel spreadsheets (for example) are not supported.</li>
<li>There is a one-line header included in the file for readability.</li>
<li>The first column contains the probe identifier. The probe IDs must exactly match the ones you provide in your Gene
    score file. Any probes not having an entry will be ignored.</li>
  <li>The second column contains a gene symbol. This should not be blank. If the gene name is not known, 
  a sequence identifier or arbitrary code can be used instead.</li>
  <li>The third column contains the gene name (or description). This can be blank.</li>
  <li>The fourth column contains a delimited list of GO identifiers. These include the "GO:" prefix. Thus they
  read "GO:00494494" and not "494494". The ids within this field can be delimited by spaces, commas, or pipe ('|') symbols.</li>
</ul>

<H2>Using files you create</H2>
<P>Annotation files that you created can be used so long as they adhere
to one of the accepted formats. There are a few things to consider:</P>
<UL>
    <LI>The probe IDs must exactly match the ones you provide in your Gene
    score file. Any probes not having an entry will be ignored.</LI>
    <LI>The gene symbols are used internally by the software to decide
    which genes are present on the array more than once. Therefore, if two
    probes refer to the same gene, make sure the symbol you use is the same
    for both probes. (It doesn't matter what the symbol is).</LI>
    <LI>The gene names or descriptions are optional, and blank values will
    just show up as "No description" or something similar.</LI>
    <LI>In the ermineJ format, the GO ids must be in "long" format (with
    the GO: prefix). The GO terms themselves should be omitted. The parents
    of all terms listed are automatically included in the analysis (subject
    to other constraints such as the maximum Gene Set size you set in the
    analysis), so there is no need to list these explicitly.</LI>
</UL>

<h2>Using files from the Affymetrix web site</h2>

<p>Obviously this only helps you if you are using an <a
	href="http://www.affymetrix.com">Affymetrix GeneChip</a>. (The writers
of ermineJ are not affiliated with Affymetrix in any way).</p>

<p>The files we tested our software on were obtained from the Affymetrix
site and are in CSV (comma-separated value) format. As of May 2005
ermineJ worked with these files, but if Affymetrix changes the format
(they have in the past) it is possible that they will no longer work
with ermineJ.</p>

<p>To use this, select the "Affy CSV" option on the <a
	href="starting.html">startup dialog</a>.</p>
