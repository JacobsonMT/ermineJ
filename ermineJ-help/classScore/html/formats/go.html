<h1>Input files:&nbsp;Gene Ontology XML</h1>

<p>ErmineJ&nbsp;currently uses the Gene Ontology&nbsp;RDF XML* file to
obtain a complete set of data about GO&nbsp;terms and their definitions.
We distribute a recent version of this file with the software. If you
want to upgrade to a newer version, go to <a
	href="http://www.godatabase.org/dev/database/archive/latest/">http://www.godatabase.org/dev/database/archive/latest/</a>
and select the latest "go_XXXXXX-termdb.rdf-xml.gz" file (not the very
large assocdb file). This file should be placed in your
ermineJ.data/genesetdata directory.</p>

<p>As of version 2.1, the files can be gzipped or zipped. There is no
need to unpack them.</p>

<p>If the link above is broken, go to <a
	href="http://www.godatabase.org/">http://www.godatabase.org/</a> and
look for the download link -- and <a
	href="mailto:pavlidis@dbmi.columbia.edu">let us know</a></p>

<p>Older versions of the GO files <a
	href="http://www.godatabase.org/dev/database">should be available</a>
as well. Problems with getting the GO XML files should be reported to
the GO web site maintainers or the go-database mailing list (not us!).</p>

<p>Note that&nbsp;the&nbsp;<A href="annotations.html">annotation file</A>
you use&nbsp;is&nbsp;not assured to be 'in synch' with the GO XML file
you download. This matters because the GO terms change, and it is
possible for an annotation file to have terms which are newer than the
GO XML file you use.</p>
<P>If you are using the annotation files we provide, you are advised use
the GO&nbsp;XML&nbsp;file that was used during the latest annotation
build. A link to that file is maintained at <a
	href="http://microarray.cpmc.columbia.edu/annots/">http://microarray.cpmc.columbia.edu/annots/</a>
.</P>
<P>If you are using an annotation file provided by a third party, or
which you made yourself, we advise that you try to use the same version
of GO that was used to created the annotations.</P>

you don't need to know.</FONT></P>
