<h1>Gene set files</h1>

<p>User-defined gene sets can be created from within ermineJ, or
imported using two different format. This page has instructions on how
to import your own files. You can either use the <A href="#option1">ermineJ-native
format</A>, or <a href="#option2">import a simple list of genes</a> .</p>

<h2><a name="option1"></a>Option 1: Use ermineJ-native format and put
the files in the genesets directory</h2>

<p>This method might be useful if you have a lot of gene sets to load,
have lists in terms of probes (not genes), or are moving an ermineJ
installation from one machine to another and are copying the custom gene
sets over.</p>

<p>Gene sets created in ermineJ are saved in, and loaded from, a simple
text file format. Knowledge of the format gives you the ability to
define gene sets outside of ermineJ. When ermineJ starts up, it looks
for these files in a predefined location (see below) and loads them.</p>

<p>Here is a sample:</p>
<pre>
probe
MyGeneSet
Genes I Like
36495_at
271_s_at
37983_at
34071_at
128_at
129_g_at
206_at
38466_at
32017_at
346_s_at
32018_at
</pre>

<p>(or <A href="../samples/geneset.txt">download the sample</A> as a
file)</p>

<p>Gene set files created by ermineJ are saved in the directory <code>ermineJ.data/genesets</code>.
This directory is installed in the directory where ermineJ is installed
(e.g., C:/ <code>Program Files/ermineJ/ermineJ.data/genesets</code>).
You should place your own "handmade" gene set files in this location so
they are automatically visible to the software.</p>

<p><strong>Note!</strong> If you create a gene set when using one microarray design, and then
    switch to another next time you run ermineJ, ermineJ will try to load your old gene sets. If
    any probes on the previous design match the identifiers on the current one, the gene set
    will be loaded to the extent it can. We may change this in a future version of ermineJ.</p>

    
<p>The full description of the format is:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Each file describes just one gene set.
	<li>The file is plain text (ASCII)
	<li>The first line describes the type of identifier in the file and is
	either "probe" or "gene".
	<li>The second line is the name of the gene set.
	<li>The second line is a description of the gene set. There is no limit
	to the length of this description but in practice it should be just a
	few words.
	<li>The third and subsequent lines are the identifiers (probe ids or
	official gene names).</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="option2"></a>Option 2: Import files containing lists of
genes using the "Define new gene set" menu item</h2>

<p>This method has the benefit of requiring a very simple format, but
you must load the files one at a time using ermineJ. (If this is a pain,
a simple Perl or Python script can convert the lists into the other
format.)</p>

<p>The file in this case is just a list of genes, with one on each line.
The names must be the gene symbols that are used in your gene annotation
file. Other symbols will be ignored. Here's an example with just three
genes:</p>
<pre>
alox12b
ALOX15
alox12
</pre>

<p>A full description of the file format is:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Each file describes just one gene set.
	<li>The file is plain text (ASCII)
	<li>Each line contains the official symbol of one gene
	<li>Capitalization is ignored
	<li>Blank lines and symbols not found in the current array design are
	ignored</li>
</ul>

<p>On loading in, the list of genes is converted to a list of probes.
You will be given the chance to edit the gene list and give it a name
before finalizing it</p>
