ErmineJ performs analyses of gene sets in high-throughput genomics data such as gene expression profiling studies. A typical goal is to determine whether particular biological pathways are "doing something interesting" in an experiment that generates long lists of candidates. The software is designed to be used by biologists with little or no informatics background. ErmineJ is free software developed by the Pavlidis lab at the University of British Columbia.
