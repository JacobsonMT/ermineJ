<h2>Frequently asked questions about Class Scoring</h2>

<ul>
<li>
<p><b>Question:</b> When I open the output file in Notepad it looks like a mess of letters and numbers.</p>
<p><b>Answer:</b> The output will not look right when viewed in a text editor or a web browser. It will look correct in Excel
if you open it as a tab delimited file.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><b>Question:</b> I don't see annotation file for my microarray. What should I do?</p>
<p><b>Answer:</b> Unfortunately we cannot generally create annotations for microarrays that are not commonly used. If we identify
a commonly used platform, we will add it. This means that 'home made' spotted microarrays are not supported in most cases. Feel free
to let us know if you have a microarray design that needs annotations for class scoring.</p>
</li>


<li>
<p><b>Question:</b> There are mistakes in the Gene Ontology annotations.</p>
<p><b>Answer:</b> We download the annotations from public sources and are not responsible for any errors. We normally update our annotations
every two months. Note that we use as many annotations as we can get, which means we use the 'IEA' annotations.</p>
</li>


<li>
<p><b>Question:</b> Which options should I use?</p>
<p><b>Answer:</b> We routinely use the "mean" class score method, with the "best" replicate scoring, with 200,000 iterations. 
However, we provide several options
to allow users to experiment with what gives them the most interesting results.</p>

<p><b>Question:</b> This software sucks, it's hard to use, buggy, and has no visualization tools.</p>
<p><b>Answer:</b> Thank you for your input. We are interested in improving the software and will inform users of new releases via our web site.</p>
