<h1>Version history</h1>

<h2>Current version</h2>

<p>Version 2.1.5 - August 12, 2005. Changes include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Bug which caused the "cancel" function to fail fixed.</li>
	<li>Reading of raw matrix files performance improvements.</li>
	<li>Correlation analysis dramatically sped up again due to a bug fix. In addition, a number of optimizations have been implemented to futher improve performance of the correlation analysis.</li>
	<li>Bug which caused poor performance of tree view after analysis fixed.</li>
</ul>

<p>Known issues:</p>



<ul>
	<li>The command to show user-defined gene sets can sometimes be
	"confused". The work-around is to just hit "Ctrl-U" twice.</li>

	<li>The id and name of user-defined gene sets cannot be changed. This
	limitation should be restricted to GO gene sets (bug 224). The
	work-around is to edit the file and then reload the gene sets.</li>

	<li>(Minor GUI) In tables shown in wizards, the table columns are
	resizable and sortable, but this is not indicated by the cursor. (bug
	212)</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2>Older versions</h2>


<p>Version 2.1.4. Changes include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Fixed bug which caused problems after loading two or more gene
	score files that had only partial gene lists with respect to the
	annotation file.(Bug 230)</li>

	<li>Fixed bug which caused error in reading preferences for the
	"details" view. The file choosers for saving data have also been
	improved to suggest a file name.</li>

	<li>(File format) The first line of a loaded gene score file is now
	ignored (e.g., it is treated as a header), as documented in the help.
	This was causing spurious warnings about mismatched names (bug 229).
	The warnings given are also more informative.</li>

	<li>(Performance) Bug which caused unnecessary slowdown of correlation
	analysis fixed. It's still slow, but usable.</li>

	<li>(Performance) Sorting of details view when sorting by gene symbol
	is now as fast as for the other columns (bug 195).</li>

	<li>(Documentation) New FAQs and more guidance on setting parameters
	and choosing methods.</li>

</ul>

<p>Version 2.1.3. Changes include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>A number of bugs in the display of user-modified or user-defined
	gene sets have been fixed.</li>
	<li>When <em>modifying</em> a GO gene set, you are no longer allowed to
	change the name or description. You can still change the members of the
	gene set.</li>
	<li>New options in gene set popup menus to manage custom gene sets.</li>
	<li>Add Gene Set menu item to reload the user-defined gene sets from
	disk (keyboard Ctrl-E).</li>
	<li>Both the data file used and the gene score file can be changed from
	menu items as well as from the analysis wizard.</li>
	<li>Additional bug and feature fixes (including issues 170, 208, 214,
	215, 218, 219, 220, 222, 223).</li>
</ul>


<p>Version 2.1.2. Changes include:
<ul>
	<li>New Feature: Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) method now
	available from all interfaces.</li>
	<li>Fixed Issue 210: Failure to save results files for some situations.</li>
	<li>Fixed Issue 204: default for "Larger scores are better" should be
	'false'.</li>
	<li>After an analysis, the results are checked for "reasonableness". If
	they are not, the user is advised to check the validity of the analysis
	settings. Unreasonable results would be p-values that are all zero, for
	example.</li>
	<li>Inconsistent behavior of "next" and "back" buttons in Analysis
	Wizard fixed.</li>
	<li>Errors during analysis now result in less silent death.</li>
	<li>Some other minor issues resolved.</li>
</ul>

</p>

<p>Version 2.1.1. Fixes bugs which caused incorrect parsing of gene
descriptions and resulted in multiple custom gene set directories. All
users should upgrade. (issues 198,199)</p>

<p>Version 2.1. Changes include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Gene sets and their results are now available in a new tree
	diagram.</li>
	<li>URLs for gene links in the details view are now modifiable.</li>
	<li>You can change the data set you are viewing in the details view.</li>
	<li>Result sets ('runs') can be renamed by using the context menu in
	the table view.</li>
	<li>A feature has been added to find gene sets by genes, in addition to
	by gene set name.</li>
	<li>The saved output files can optionally contain the names of the
	genes in each gene set.</li>
	<li>The GO aspect(s) to be analyzed can be controlled.</li>
	<li>New tooltips have been added, to display the aspect and definition
	of a gene set</li>
	<li>GO and gene annotation files can be ZIP or GZIP compressed.</li>
	<li>Logfile is saved for all interactive runs of ermineJ, and is
	viewable from the "help" menu.</li>
	<li>For programmers, a simplified API is available to help integrate
	ermineJ functionality into your code.</li>
	<li>Further improvements and updates to the documentation.</li>
	<li>Program startup time has been improved, fixing slowdown introduced
	in 2.0.4</li>
	<li>Assorted minor bug fixes and improvements, too many to list.</li>
</ul>

<p>(not released): Version 2.0.5. Annotation files can be Affymetrix CSV
files. Documentation has been improved. A number of other minor fixes
and improvements, primarily affecting the GUI.</p>

<p>April 27 2005: Version 2.0.4 released. Annotation files no longer
need to contain lists of all parent terms, these are added b the
software. This means initializing the software is a little slower but
makes it much easier to use third-party annotation files. A number of
other minor issues and bugs were also fixed.</p>

<p>April 7 2005: Version 2.0.3 released. This fixes a few GUI bugs and
increases the usability of the 'load analysis' feature</p>

<P>January 4 2005: Version 2.0.2 released. This release addresses
several minor bugs relating to software usability. The software now
handles gene scores that are not p values more gracefully.</P>

<p>December 23 2004: Version 2.0.1 released. This maintenance release
addresses a number of bugs, the most serious of which was a bug in the
"ORA" analysis that could lead to inaccurate findings in some cases. In
addition, the handling of gene scores that are not raw p-values has been
made more flexible. Most of the remaining bugs are minor and relate to
the usability of the software, but all users should update to this
version. There are also many improvements to the documentation.</p>

<p>October 13 2004 Version 2.0 released. This fixes several GUI bugs
that affected use under Linux and Mac, as well as some other minor bugs
and documentation improvements.</p>

<p>September 28 2004 Version 2.0b7. This further improves documentation
and fixes bugs, including one that caused gene set probe numbers to be
displayed incorrectly when data had been filtered.</p>

<p>September 22 2004 Version 2.0b6 released. This fixes some major bugs
in the visualization component of the software, and includes some
improvements to the documentation and error messages. New feature: some
methods for speeding up the resampling-based analysis have been
implemented. These are particularly helpful for the
correlation-analysis. The new methods use some approximations that are
documented <A href="ermineJ-help/html/tutorial/approximations.html">here</A>.</p>

<p>August 18 2004 - Version 2.0b5 released. This introduces some minor
new features and fixes several bugs, one of which are serious affecting
the correlation analysis. In addition, the advertised command line tool
is now operational.</p>

<p>August 12 2004 - Version 2.0b4 released. This is a maintenance
release that fixes a number of bugs and issues, some of which are
serious. All users should update to this version.</p>

<p>July 20 2004 - Version 2.0b3 released. This is an extensive rewrite
of the user interface, with numerous new features, including the ability
to define your own gene sets and visualize the analysis results. This is
a late-beta release as we iron out bugs and performance issues.</p>
