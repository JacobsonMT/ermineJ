		<h2>
			Current version
		</h2>

		<p>
			Version 2.1.16 - ( ) Changes include:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Fix 'generic' ermineJ.bat script to use java.exe instead of javaw.exe, and fix stray "\nul".
			</li>
			<li>Fix broken link to annotation files on the help pages.</li>
		</ul>



		<hr />


		<h2>
			Older versions
		</h2>


		<p>
			Version 2.1.15 - (July 2007) Changes include:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				An error was made in the two previous distributions: an incorrect
				jar file was included in the windows installer, so some bugfixes
				were not correctly included. In particular, an issue with how the GO
				classes were read in is now consistent between all distributions.
			</li>
			<li>
				Output file improvement: When 'Include all genes in output' is
				checked, the gene names are sorted.
			</li>
			<li>
				Some bugs in the Command Line Interface were fixed, which caused
				errors when using some option combinations.
			</li>
			<li>
				A bug in the software API which rendered it pretty much unusable was
				fixed.
			</li>
			<li>
				There were problems with some command line arguments not being
				recognized correctly.
			</li>
			<li>
				Minor enhancement: when the gene symbols are included in analysis
				output files, they are sorted by name.
		</ul>




		<p>
			Version 2.1.14 - (July 2007) Changes include:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Minor bug fix: Probes lacking any annotations are handled a little
				differently, avoiding an annoying error message. This does have a
				minor effect on the analysis.
			</li>

			<li>
				A variety of cosmetic and GUI bugs have been fixed, primarily
				affecting Linux Fedora Core users.
			</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			Version 2.1.13 - () Changes include:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Bug fix: If gene scores were negative, the "use best score" option
				might not work correctly. Thanks to Hubert Rehrauer for the fix.
			</li>
			<li>
				Bug fix: Some parent terms were not being included in when inferring
				annotations. Thanks to Salvatore Micciche for reporting this.
			</li>
			<li>
				Command line interface overhauled. This should fix problems some
				users had with certain option combinations.
			</li>
			<li>
				Enhancement: repeated occurrences of the same identifier in the gene
				score file results in a warning.
			</li>
			<li>
				Minor enhancement: GO categories can be viewed even when score file
				doesn't match annotation file.
			</li>
			<li>
				Various minor cosmetic fixes.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Version 2.1.12 - (August 8 2006) Changes include:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Added internationalization support for input files (addresses bugs
				302, 321).
			</li>
			<li>
				Output file format had misaligned columns. Duplicate column names
				were fixed and an unused column was removed (bug 322).
			</li>
			<li>
				Affymetrix annotation files properly parsed in the command line
				interface (bug 323).
			</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			Version 2.1.11 - (July 12 2006) Internal release
		</p>

		<p>
			Version 2.1.10 - (May 24 2006) Changes include:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				ErmineJ is now licensed under the
				<a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0">Apache 2.0</a>
				license.
			</li>
			<li>
				(Input files) Annotation files from
				<a
					href="http://www.chem.agilent.com/scripts/generic.asp?lpage=5175&indcol=N&prodcol=Y">Agilent</a>
				are supported directly.
			</li>
			<li>
				(Dev) Code has been restructured. This will only affect developers
				using ermineJ code.
			</li>
			<li>
				Fixed bug: If you tried to run a correlation analysis without a gene
				score file set (which is supposed to be irrelevant), the analysis
				would fail.
			</li>
			<li>
				Fixed bug: "Null pointer exceptions" when custom gene score files
				are missing.
			</li>
			<li>
				Fixed bug: It was still possible to get errors when loading raw data
				files for analysis, this has finally been fixed.
			</li>
			<li>
				(Docs) Documention of custom gene sets fixed to reflect correct
				location of ermineJ.data (in your home directory, not the ermineJ
				installation directory).
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Known issues:
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li>
				The command to show user-defined gene sets can sometimes be
				"confused". The work-around is to just hit "Ctrl-U" twice.
			</li>

			<li>
				The id and name of user-defined gene sets cannot be changed. This
				limitation should be restricted to GO gene sets (bug 224). The
				work-around is to edit the file and then reload the gene sets.
			</li>

			<li>
				(Minor GUI) In tables shown in wizards, the table columns are
				resizable and sortable, but this is not indicated by the cursor.
				(bug 212)
			</li>

		</ul>


		<p>
			Version 2.1.9 - (Feb 8 2006) Changes include:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Restricting analysis to specific GO aspects wasn't working for ROC
				analysis (fixes bug 285).
			</li>
			<li>
				Loading an analysis from disk failed if the raw data file was not
				set (bug 291).
			</li>
			<li>
				You can now save the gene set information in the details view even
				without loading the raw data (bug 290).
			</li>
			<li>
				Small p-values were rounded to zero in the output file (bug 289).
			</li>
			<li>
				The path to the annotation file is stored in the output file. This
				currently isn't used by the software but is good for user records.
			</li>
			<li>
				Command line interface: -F (--format) option (which took an
				argument) changed to -A. Using the -A option indicates that the
				annotation file is in "Affymetrix" format. Fixes bug 272.
			</li>
			<li>
				The format of the Annotation files has been made more flexible. The
				GO term field can be delimited with characters other than '|' such
				as commas or spaces (issue 286).
			</li>
			<li>
				The format of the annotation files has been documented (see
				<a href="ermineJ-help/classScore/html/formats/annotations.html">this
					page</a>) (issue 287).
			</li>
			<li>
				Minor GUI tweaks to improve portability (bug 269).
			</li>
		</ul>


		<p>
			Version 2.1.8 - (December 20 2005) Changes include:
		</p>

				Bug fixed that caused "null" error in viewing gene set data under
				some conditions.
			</li>
		</ul>


		<p>
			Version 2.1.7 - (November 9 2005) Changes include:
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li>
				Command line option to output all genes in each gene set added
				("-j").
			</li>
			<li>
				Command line error output is more helpful.
			</li>
			<li>
				Result file contains parameters when using command line.
			</li>
			<li>
				Bug in handling custom annotation files fixed.
			</li>
			<li>
				Correlation score performance improved (again).
			</li>
		</ul>


		<p>
			Version 2.1.6 - September 2, 2005. Changes include:
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li>
				User-defined gene sets were not being used for analysis. There were
				also related problems with editing and viewing gene sets once
				created (Fixes for bugs 256, 257 and 258).
			</li>
		</ul>


		<p>
			Version 2.1.5 - August 12, 2005. Changes include:
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li>
				Bug which caused the "cancel" function to fail fixed.
			</li>
			<li>
				Reading of raw matrix files performance improvements.
			</li>
			<li>
				Correlation analysis dramatically sped up again due to a bug fix. In
				addition, a number of optimizations have been implemented to futher
				improve performance of the correlation analysis.
			</li>
			<li>
				Bug which caused poor performance of tree view after analysis fixed.
			</li>
			<li>
				Bug which left grouping separators in numbers for the gene details
				matrix output files fixed.
			</li>
		</ul>


		<p>
			Version 2.1.4. Changes include:
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li>
				Fixed bug which caused problems after loading two or more gene score
				files that had only partial gene lists with respect to the
				annotation file.(Bug 230)
			</li>

			<li>
				Fixed bug which caused error in reading preferences for the
				"details" view. The file choosers for saving data have also been
				improved to suggest a file name.
			</li>

			<li>
				(File format) The first line of a loaded gene score file is now
				ignored (e.g., it is treated as a header), as documented in the
				help. This was causing spurious warnings about mismatched names (bug
				229). The warnings given are also more informative.
			</li>

			<li>
				(Performance) Bug which caused unnecessary slowdown of correlation
				analysis fixed. It's still slow, but usable.
			</li>

			<li>
				(Performance) Sorting of details view when sorting by gene symbol is
				now as fast as for the other columns (bug 195).
			</li>

			<li>
				(Documentation) New FAQs and more guidance on setting parameters and
				choosing methods.
			</li>

		</ul>


		<p>
			Version 2.1.3. Changes include:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				A number of bugs in the display of user-modified or user-defined
				gene sets have been fixed.
			</li>
			<li>
				When
				<em>modifying</em> a GO gene set, you are no longer allowed to
				change the name or description. You can still change the members of
				the gene set.
			</li>
			<li>
				New options in gene set popup menus to manage custom gene sets.
			</li>
			<li>
				Add Gene Set menu item to reload the user-defined gene sets from
				disk (keyboard Ctrl-E).
			</li>
			<li>
				Both the data file used and the gene score file can be changed from
				menu items as well as from the analysis wizard.
			</li>
			<li>
				Additional bug and feature fixes (including issues 170, 208, 214,
				215, 218, 219, 220, 222, 223).
			</li>
		</ul>


		<p>
			Version 2.1.2. Changes include:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				New Feature: Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) method now
				available from all interfaces.
			</li>
			<li>
				Fixed Issue 210: Failure to save results files for some situations.
			</li>
			<li>
				Fixed Issue 204: default for "Larger scores are better" should be
				'false'.
			</li>
			<li>
				After an analysis, the results are checked for "reasonableness". If
				they are not, the user is advised to check the validity of the
				analysis settings. Unreasonable results would be p-values that are
				all zero, for example.
			</li>
			<li>
				Inconsistent behavior of "next" and "back" buttons in Analysis
				Wizard fixed.
			</li>
			<li>
				Errors during analysis now result in less silent death.

		</ul>


		<p>
			(not released): Version 2.0.5. Annotation files can be Affymetrix CSV
			files. Documentation has been improved. A number of other minor fixes
			and improvements, primarily affecting the GUI.
		</p>


		<p>
			April 27 2005: Version 2.0.4 released. Annotation files no longer
			need to contain lists of all parent terms, these are added b the
			software. This means initializing the software is a little slower but
			makes it much easier to use third-party annotation files. A number of
			other minor issues and bugs were also fixed.
		</p>


		<p>
			April 7 2005: Version 2.0.3 released. This fixes a few GUI bugs and
			increases the usability of the 'load analysis' feature
		</p>


		<P>
			January 4 2005: Version 2.0.2 released. This release addresses
			several minor bugs relating to software usability. The software now
			handles gene scores that are not p values more gracefully.
		</P>


		<p>
			December 23 2004: Version 2.0.1 released. This maintenance release
			addresses a number of bugs, the most serious of which was a bug in
			the "ORA" analysis that could lead to inaccurate findings in some
			cases. In addition, the handling of gene scores that are not raw
			p-values has been made more flexible. Most of the remaining bugs are
			minor and relate to the usability of the software, but all users
			should update to this version. There are also many improvements to
			the documentation.
		</p>


		<p>
			October 13 2004 Version 2.0 released. This fixes several GUI bugs
			that affected use under Linux and Mac, as well as some other minor
			bugs and documentation improvements.
		</p>


		<p>
			September 28 2004 Version 2.0b7. This further improves documentation
			and fixes bugs, including one that caused gene set probe numbers to
			be displayed incorrectly when data had been filtered.
		</p>


		<p>
			September 22 2004 Version 2.0b6 released. This fixes some major bugs
			in the visualization component of the software, and includes some
			improvements to the documentation and error messages. New feature:
			some methods for speeding up the resampling-based analysis have been
			implemented. These are particularly helpful for the
			correlation-analysis. The new methods use some approximations that
			are documented
			<A href="ermineJ-help/html/tutorial/approximations.html">here</A>.
		</p>


		<p>
			August 18 2004 - Version 2.0b5 released. This introduces some minor
			new features and fixes several bugs, one of which are serious
			affecting the correlation analysis. In addition, the advertised
			command line tool is now operational.
		</p>


		<p>
			August 12 2004 - Version 2.0b4 released. This is a maintenance
			release that fixes a number of bugs and issues, some of which are
			serious. All users should update to this version.
		</p>


		<p>
			July 20 2004 - Version 2.0b3 released. This is an extensive rewrite
			of the user interface, with numerous new features, including the
			ability to define your own gene sets and visualize the analysis
			results. This is a late-beta release as we iron out bugs and
			performance issues.
