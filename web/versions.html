<h1>ErmineJ version history</h1>

<h2>Current version</h2>

<p>Version 2.1.1. Fixes bugs which caused incorrect parsing of gene
descriptions and resulted in multiple custom gene set directories. All
users should upgrade. (issues 198,199)</p>

<h3>Older versions</h3>

<p>Version 2.1. Changes include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Gene sets and their results are now available in a new tree
	diagram.</li>
	<li>URLs for gene links in the details view are now modifiable.</li>
	<li>You can change the data set you are viewing in the details view.</li>
	<li>Result sets ('runs') can be renamed by using the context menu in
	the table view.</li>
	<li>A feature has been added to find gene sets by genes, in addition to
	by gene set name.</li>
	<li>The saved output files can optionally contain the names of the
	genes in each gene set.</li>
	<li>The GO aspect(s) to be analyzed can be controlled.</li>
	<li>New tooltips have been added, to display the aspect and definition
	of a gene set</li>
	<li>GO and gene annotation files can be ZIP or GZIP compressed.</li>
	<li>Logfile is saved for all interactive runs of ermineJ, and is
	viewable from the "help" menu.</li>
	<li>For programmers, a simplified API is available to help integrate
	ermineJ functionality into your code.</li>
	<li>Further improvements and updates to the documentation.</li>
	<li>Program startup time has been improved, fixing slowdown introduced
	in 2.0.4</li>
	<li>Assorted minor bug fixes and improvements, too many to list.</li>
</ul>

<p>(not released): Version 2.0.5. Annotation files can be Affymetrix CSV
files. Documentation has been improved. A number of other minor fixes
and improvements, primarily affecting the GUI.</p>

<p>April 27 2005: Version 2.0.4 released. Annotation files no longer
need to contain lists of all parent terms, these are added b the
software. This means initializing the software is a little slower but
makes it much easier to use third-party annotation files. A number of
other minor issues and bugs were also fixed.</p>

<p>April 7 2005: Version 2.0.3 released. This fixes a few GUI bugs and
increases the usability of the 'load analysis' feature</p>

<P>January 4 2005: Version 2.0.2 released. This release addresses
several minor bugs relating to software usability. The software now
handles gene scores that are not p values more gracefully.</P>

<p>December 23 2004: Version 2.0.1 released. This maintenance release
addresses a number of bugs, the most serious of which was a bug in the
"ORA" analysis that could lead to inaccurate findings in some cases. In
addition, the handling of gene scores that are not raw p-values has been
made more flexible. Most of the remaining bugs are minor and relate to
the usability of the software, but all users should update to this
version. There are also many improvements to the documentation.</p>

<p>October 13 2004 Version 2.0 released. This fixes several GUI bugs
that affected use under Linux and Mac, as well as some other minor bugs
and documentation improvements.</p>

<p>September 28 2004 Version 2.0b7. This further improves documentation
and fixes bugs, including one that caused gene set probe numbers to be
displayed incorrectly when data had been filtered.</p>

<p>September 22 2004 Version 2.0b6 released. This fixes some major bugs
in the visualization component of the software, and includes some
improvements to the documentation and error messages. New feature: some
methods for speeding up the resampling-based analysis have been
implemented. These are particularly helpful for the
correlation-analysis. The new methods use some approximations that are
documented <A href="ermineJ-help/html/tutorial/approximations.html">here</A>.</p>

<p>August 18 2004 - Version 2.0b5 released. This introduces some minor
new features and fixes several bugs, one of which are serious affecting
the correlation analysis. In addition, the advertised command line tool
is now operational.</p>

<p>August 12 2004 - Version 2.0b4 released. This is a maintenance
release that fixes a number of bugs and issues, some of which are
serious. All users should update to this version.</p>

<p>July 20 2004 - Version 2.0b3 released. This is an extensive rewrite
of the user interface, with numerous new features, including the ability
to define your own gene sets and visualize the analysis results. This is
a late-beta release as we iron out bugs and performance issues.</p>
