  <h1>Version history</h1>
      <p>December 23 2004: Version 2.0.1 released. This maintenance release addresses a
          number of bugs, the most serious of which was a bug in the "ORA" analysis that
          could lead to inaccurate findings in some cases. In addition, the handling
          of gene scores that are not raw p-values has been made more
          flexible. Most of the remaining bugs are minor and relate to
          the usability of the software, but all users should update to
          this version. There are also many improvements to the
          documentation.</p>

          <p>October 13 2004 Version 2.0 released. This fixes several
          GUI bugs that affected use under Linux and Mac, as well as
          some other minor bugs and documentation improvements.</p>
          
          <p>September 28 2004 Version 2.0b7. This further improves
          documentation and fixes bugs, including one that caused gene
          set probe numbers to be displayed incorrectly when data had
          been filtered.</p>

          <p>September 22 2004 Version 2.0b6 released. This fixes some
          major bugs in the visualization component of the software,
          and includes some improvements to the documentation and error
          messages. New feature: some methods for speeding up the
          resampling-based analysis have been implemented. These are
          particularly helpful for the correlation-analysis. The new
          methods use some approximations that are documented <a href=
          "ermineJ-help/html/tutorial/approximations.html">here</a>.</p>

          <p>August 18 2004 - Version 2.0b5 released. This introduces

          <p>July 20 2004 - Version 2.0b3 released. This is an
          extensive rewrite of the user interface, with numerous new
          features, including the ability to define your own gene sets
          and visualize the analysis results. This is a late-beta
          release as we iron out bugs and performance issues.</p>
