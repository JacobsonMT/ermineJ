						Old ermineJ news

					<p>
						Version 2.1.15 - (July 2007) This is primarily a bugfix release.
						The most significant changes are:
					</p>

					<ul>
						<li>
							An error was made in the two previous distributions: an incorrect
							jar file was included in the windows installer, so some bugfixes
							were not correctly included. In particular, an issue with how the
							GO classes were read in is now consistent between all
							distributions. Thanks to Oliver Homann for bringing this to our
							attention.
						</li>
						<li>
							There were problems with some command line arguments not being
							recognized correctly.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						April 2007
					<li>
						We fixed two bugs that can affect the analysis. First, it was
						possible for some implicit GO term associations to be missed. This
						primarily affected large GO categories that most users tend to
						remove from consideration, but may affect analyses. Second, there
						was a problem using input scores containing negative values and
						the "best score" option to handle multiple occurrence of genes on
						array designs. Users who always use positive values would not be
						affected by this problem. We thank the users who identified
						reported these problems!
					</li>

					<li>
						The command line interface has been largely rewritten and should
						be more robust, easier to use, and easier to understand.
					</li>
					<li>
						A variety of cosmetic and GUI bugs have been fixed, especially
						affecting Linux and Macintosh users.
					</li>
					</p>
					<p>
						September 2 2005:
						<strong>Version 2.1.6</strong> - Maintanance release to fix bugs
						in reading and utilization of user-defined gene sets introduced
						since 2.1.3.
					</p>

					<p>
						August 16 2005:
						<strong> Version 2.1.5</strong> - Maintenance release, primarily
						fixing performance issues. Most importantly, a bug causing slow
						responses in the tree view after an analysis has been fixed, and
						the performance of the correlation analysis has been drastically
						improved.
					</p>

					<p>
						July 11 2005:
						<strong> Version 2.1.4</strong> - Maintenance release to fix a
						number of recently discovered issues affecting the user interface,
						performance, and reading of data files.
					</p>

					<p>
						June 10 2005:
						<strong>Version 2.1.3</strong> - Maintenance release to fix a
						variety of bugs, and introduces a few minor new features.
					</p>

					<p>
						June 7 2005:
						<strong> Version 2.1.2</strong> - New feature: Receiver operator
						characteristic (
						<a href="ermineJ-help/classScore/html/tutorial/roc.html">ROC</a>)
						analysis. Also fixes a number of bugs, all users should upgrade.
					</p>

					<p>
						June 2 2005:
						<strong> Version 2.1.1</strong> - Fixes bugs which caused
						incorrect parsing of gene descriptions and resulted in multiple
						custom gene set directories. All users should upgrade.
					</p>

					<p>
						June 1 2005:
						<STRONG> Version 2.1 has been released</STRONG> . Many new
						improvements and changes.
					</p>
