    <h2>Multiple Test Correction in ermineJ</h2>

    <p>ErmineJ uses Benjamini-Hochberg correction of p values to
    determine which gene sets are selected with a false discovery rate
    (FDR) of 0.05. Such sets are colored blue in the pval column, as
    shown in the figure below. Gene sets which meet an FDR of 0.1 are
    grey. Gene sets which to not meet this criterion are not
    colored.</p>

    <p>Brighter shades of color indicate even lower FDRs. Currently the
    colors indicate FDRs of 0.001, 0.01, and 0.05.</p>

    <p>Note that the color reflects the FDR when the p values for the
    gene set indicated is used as the threshold. Thus it is possible
    for the FDR to go up and down as you go down the list. It is not
    uncommon for the FDR at very stringent thresholds to be above 0.05,
    while at less stringent thresholds is can be lower. This
    counterintuitive result is due to the way the FDR is computed. If
    you want to control the FDR at 0.05, you should pick the
    lowest-ranked 'blue' gene set, and all gene sets listed above would
    be selected.</p>

    <p>If you feel using the FDR is not appropriate, other multiple
    test correction methods such as Bonferroni can be accessed from the
    command line interface. You can also work with the results file you
    save to compute Bonferroni or other types of corrected p values
    from your data.</p>
