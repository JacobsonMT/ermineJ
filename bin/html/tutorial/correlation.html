    <h1>Tutorial: Correlation resampling</h1>

    <h2>Method Overview</h2>

    <p>Unlike ORA and Gene Score Resampling, this method examines the
    gene expression profiles themselves, not the gene scores for each
    gene. A score is computed for a gene set based on how correlated
    the expression profiles are.</p>

    <p>This can be thought of as a measure of how well the genes in the
    set cluster together, but they need not all be in the same cluster.
    Thus a gene set that contains two coherent clusters that encompass
    most of the genes in the set will tend to get a good score (though
    not as good as a gene set that is just one big cluster).</p>

    <p>Correlation resampling is the most computationally intensive
    method implemented by ermineJ. For this reason we recommend setting
    the number of iterations lower, perhaps only 10,000. In addition,
    running larger class sizes takes longer than smaller ones, a
    consideration you might use when setting the parameters.</p>

    <h2>Walkthrough</h2>

    <p>If you have read the ORA and Gene Score resampling pages, you
    will recognize the first 4 steps of the wizard. The only different
    one is the last one:</p>

    <p><font color="#990000"><strong>Note</strong></font> that the
    "gene replicate treatment" choice in step 4 does not apply to
    correlation analysis at this time. All correlation analyses use the
    "mean" method of weighting multiple comparisons among genes.
    Comparisons of a gene to itself are always skipped. That is, if
    there are two probes for a gene, they are not compared.</p>
