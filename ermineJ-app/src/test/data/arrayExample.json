			"description" : " The U133 set includes 2 arrays with a total of 44928 entries and was indexed 29-Jan-2002. The set includes over 1,000,000 unique oligonucleotide features covering more than 39,000 transcript variants, which in turn represent greater than 33,000 of the best characterized human genes. Sequences were selected from GenBank, dbEST, and RefSeq. Sequence clusters were created from Build 133 of UniGene (April 20, 2001) and refined by analysis and comparison with a number of other publicly available databases including the Washington University EST trace repository and the University of California, Santa Cruz golden-path human genome database (April 2001 release). In addition, ESTs were analyzed for untrimmed low-quality sequence information, correct orientation, false priming, false clustering, alternative splicing and alternative polyadenylation.

			"description" : " The GeneChip Rat Genome 230 2.0 Array is a powerful tool for toxicology, neurobiology, and other applications using rat as a model organism.  - Provides comprehensive coverage of the transcribed rat genome on a single array - Comprised of more than 31,000 probe sets, analyzing over 30,000 transcripts and variants from over 28,000 well-substantiated rat genes - The publicly available draft of the rat genome and leading public rat databases were used to refine sequences and provide a higher quality of data output  All probe sets represented on the GeneChip Rat Expression Set 230 are included on the GeneChip Rat Genome 230 2.0 Array. Sequences used in the design of the GeneChip Rat Genome 230 2.0 Array were selected from GenBank, dbEST, and RefSeq. The sequence clusters were created from the UniGene database (Build 99, June 2002) and then refined by analysis and comparison with the publicly available draft assembly of the rat genome from the Baylor College of Medicine Human Genome Sequencing Center (June 2002).  The GeneChip Rat Genome 230 2.0 Array includes representation of the RefSeq database sequences and probe sets related to sequences and refined EST clusters previously represented on the GeneChip Rat Genome U34 Set.  Oligonucleotide probes complementary to each corresponding sequence are synthesized in situ on the arrays. Eleven pairs of oligonucleotide probes are used to measure the level of transcription of each sequence represented on the GeneChip Rat Genome 230 2.0 Array.
